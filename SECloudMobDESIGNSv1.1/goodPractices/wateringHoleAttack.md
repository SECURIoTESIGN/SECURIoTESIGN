# Watering Hole Attack

An attacker infects the pages frequently visited by target users with malicious software, and the attack is eventually delivered when they view the infected pages.

## Definition

In this type of attack, unlike botnet or phishing, instead of actively sending malicious emails, the attacker can identify third party websites that are frequently visited by the target people and try to infect one or more of these websites with malware. Eventually, delivery occurs when the attacked user visits or views these infected pages.

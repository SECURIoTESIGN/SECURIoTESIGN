<h1>Java and C# Security Flavour Implementation</h1>
<p>Since mobile-application security for the permissions-based Android platform and currently use Java and C# programming languages, in order to ensure security in the software, the SDLC should take into account the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use mechanisms that enforce access control of applications to system resources, by defining permissions and protection domains and by using access control algorithms;</li>
<li>Pay attention to setting the access level (private, package, protected and public) for each reference to an element of a primitive data or to an object;
 * Use mechanisms that enforce language conventions, that is, lower-level mechanisms that require, among other things, that programs interfere with the normal operation of the sandbox, during compilation, loading in the virtual machine (VM) of the bytecodes, and execution. For compilation and loading in the VM of the bytecodes, static code analysis is used, and dynamic code analysis is performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of runtime authorization failures, when an access control policy does not grant sufficient permissions to a user or an access control policy grants users unneeded permissions, the system may be exposed to security attacks. In this case, it is recommended to use the two major approaches in the Java and .Net Common Language Runtime platforms:</p>
<p>* Stack-based Access Control (SBAC): Ensure that only programs that satisfy a set of permission requirements gain access to restricted resources. SBAC systems should always stick to the Principle of Least Privilege;
 * Role-based Access Control (RBAC): is a mechanism to restrict access to authorized users. RBAC systems provide access control based on permissions and roles.</p>
<p>Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as: 
 * Missing authentication: Missing authentication is a security vulnerability that occurs in software that does not perform any authentication for functionalities that require a provable user identity or consume a significant amount of resources.</p>
<h2>Input Validation</h2>
<p><strong>Input validation</strong> is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering malfunction of various downstream components. </p>
<p><strong>Implementing input validation</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>Data type validators available natively in web application frameworks </li>
<li>Validation against JSON Schema and XML Schema (XSD) for input in these formats. </li>
<li>Type conversion (e.g. Integer.parseInt() in Java, int() in Python) with strict exception handling </li>
<li>Minimum and maximum value range check for numerical parameters and dates </li>
<li>Minimum and maximum length check for strings. </li>
<li>Array of allowed values for small sets of string parameters (e.g. days of week). </li>
<li>Regular expressions for any other structured data covering the whole input string (^...$) and not using "any character" wildcard (such as . or \S) </li>
</ul>
<p>If it's well structured data, like dates, social security numbers, zip codes, e-mail addresses, etc. then the developer should be able to define a very strong validation pattern, usually based on regular expressions, for validating such input. 
If the input field comes from a fixed set of options, like a drop down list or radio buttons, then the input needs to match exactly one of the values offered to the user in the first place. 
Free-form text, especially with Unicode characters, is perceived as difficult to validate due to a relatively large space of characters that need to be whitelisted. 
The primary means of input validation for free-form text input should be: </p>
<ul>
<li>Normalization: Ensure canonical encoding is used across all the text and no invalid characters are present. </li>
<li>Character category whitelisting: Unicode allows whitelisting categories such as "decimal digits" or "letters" which  not only covers the Latin alphabet but also various other scripts used globally (e.g. Arabic, Cyryllic, CJK ideographs etc). </li>
<li>Individual character whitelisting: If you allow letters and ideographs in names and also want to allow apostrophe ' for Irish names, but don't want to allow the whole punctuation category. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Client Side vs Server Side Validation</strong>     <br />
Be aware that any JavaScript input validation performed on the client can be bypassed by an attacker that disables 
JavaScript or uses a Web Proxy. Ensure that any input validation performed on the client is also performed on the server. </p>
<p><strong>Email Validation Basics</strong>   <br />
 Many web applications do not treat email addresses correctly due to common misconceptions about what constitutes 
 a valid address. Specifically, it is completely valid to have an mailbox address which: </p>
<ul>
<li>Is case sensitive in the local portion of the address (left of the rightmost @ character). </li>
<li>Has non-alphanumeric characters in the local-part (including + and @). </li>
<li>Has zero or more labels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Following RFC 5321, best practice for validating an email address would be to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Check for presence of at least one @ symbol in the address. </li>
<li>Ensure the local-part is no longer than 64 octets. </li>
<li>Ensure the domain is no longer than 255 octets. </li>
<li>Ensure the address is deliverable.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>An architectural decision must be made to determine the appropriate method to protect data at rest. There are such wide varieties of products, methods and mechanisms for cryptographic storage.The general practices and required minimum key length depending on the scenario listed below: </p>
<p><strong> Good practices: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptographic algorithms are up to date and in-line with industry standards. This includes, but is not limited to outdated block ciphers (e.g. DES), stream ciphers (e.g. RC4), as well as hash functions (e.g. MD5) and broken random number generators like Dual_EC_DRBG (even if they are NIST certified). All of these should be marked as insecure and should not be used and removed from the application and server.</li>
<li>Key lengths are in-line with industry standards and provide protection for sufficient amount of time. A comparison of different key lengths and protection they provide taking into account Moore's law is available online.</li>
<li>Cryptographic means are not mixed with each other: e.g. you do not sign with a public key, or try to reuse a keypair used for a signature to do encryption.</li>
<li>Cryptographic parameters are well defined within reasonable range. This includes, but is not limited to: cryptographic salt, which should be at least the same length as hash function output, reasonable choice of password derivation function and iteration count (e.g. PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt), IVs being random and unique, fit-for-purpose block encryption modes (e.g. ECB should not be used, except specific cases), key management being done properly (e.g. 3DES should have three independent keys) and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Recommended Algorithms: </strong>
 * Confidentiality algorithms: AES-GCM-256 or ChaCha20-Poly1305;
 * Integrity algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Blake2;
 * Digital signature algorithms: RSA (3072 bits and higher), ECDSA with NIST P-384;
 * Key establishment algorithms: RSA (3072 bits and higher), DH (3072 bits or higher), ECDH with NIST P-384;
 * Application must be capable of using end-to-end encryption via SSL / TLS in relation to sensitive data in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should always rely on secure hardware (if available) for storing encryption keys, performing cryptographic operations, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Cryptographic Storage Design:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>All protocols and algorithms for authentication and secure communication should be well vetted by the cryptographic community. </li>
<li>Ensure certificates are properly validated against the hostnames users  whom they are meant for. </li>
<li>Avoid using wildcard certificates unless there is a business need for it </li>
<li>Maintain a cryptographic standard to ensure that the developer community knows about the approved ciphersuits for network security protocols, algorithms, permitted use, cryptoperiods and Key Management. </li>
<li>Only store sensitive data that you need </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use strong approved Authenticated Encryption</strong>      <br />
CCM or GCM are approved Authenticated Encryption modes based on AES algorithm. </p>
<p><strong>Use strong approved cryptographic algorithms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not implement an existing cryptographic algorithm on your own, no matter how easy it appears. * Instead, use widely accepted algorithms and widely accepted implementations.  </li>
<li>Only use approved public algorithms such as AES, RSA public key cryptography, and SHA-256 or better for hashing. </li>
<li>Do not use weak algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA1. </li>
<li>Avoid hashing for password storage,instead use Argon2, PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.  </li>
<li>See NIST approved algorithms or ISO TR 14742 "Recommendations on Cryptographic Algorithms or Algorithms", key size and parameters by  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security.  </li>
<li>If a password is being used to protect keys then the password strength should be sufficient for the strength of the keys it is protecting.  * When 3DES is used, ensure K1 != K2 != K3, and the minimum key length must be 192 bits .  </li>
<li>Do not use ECB mode for encrypting lots of data (the other modes are better because they chain the blocks of data together to improve the data security).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use strong random numbers</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all random numbers, especially those used for cryptographic parameters (keys, IV's, MAC tags), random file names, random GUIDs, and random strings are generated in a cryptographically strong fashion. </li>
<li>Ensure that random algorithms are seeded with sufficient entropy. </li>
<li>Tools like NIST RNG Test tool can be used to comprehensively assess the quality of a Random Number Generator by 
reading e.g. 128MB of data from the RNG source and then assessing its randomness properties with the tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following libraries are considered weak random numbers generators and should not be used: </p>
<p>C library: random(), rand(), use getrandom(2) instead     <br />
Java library: java.util.Random() instead use java.security.SecureRandom instead   <br />
For secure random number generation, refer to NIST SP 800-90A. CTR-DRBG, HASH-DRBG, HMAC-DRBG are recommended</p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>Authorization is the process where requests to access a particular resource should be granted or denied. It should be noted that authorization is not equivalent to authentication - as these terms and their definitions are frequently confused. 
Authentication is providing and validating identity. 
Authorization includes the execution rules that determines what functionality and data the user (or Principal) may access, ensuring the proper allocation of access rights after authentication is successful. </p>
<p>Web applications need access controls to allow users (with varying privileges) to use the application. They also need administrators to manage the applications access control rules and the granting of permissions or entitlements to users and other entities. </p>
<p><strong>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>  <br />
Access decisions are based on an individual's roles and responsibilities within the organization or user base. An RBAC access control framework should provide web application security administrators with the ability to determine who can perform what actions, when, from where, in what order, and in some cases under what relational circumstances. </p>
<p>Advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>Roles are assigned based on organizational structure with emphasis on the organizational security policy </li>
<li>Easy to use </li>
<li>Easy to administer </li>
<li>Built into most frameworks </li>
<li>Aligns with security principles like segregation of duties and least privileges </li>
</ul>
<p>Problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation of the roles and accesses has to be maintained stringently. </li>
<li>Multi-tenancy can not be implemented effectively unless there is a way to associate the roles with multi-tenancy capability requirements e.g. OU in Active   Directory   </li>
<li>There is a tendency for scope creep to happen e.g. more accesses and privileges can be given than intended for. Or a user might be included in two roles if proper access reviews and subsequent revocation is not performed.</li>
<li>Does not support data based access control </li>
</ul>
<p>Areas of caution: </p>
<ul>
<li>Roles must be only be transferred or delegated using strict sign-offs and procedures. </li>
<li>When a user changes his role to another one, the administrator must make sure that the earlier access is revoked such that at any given point of time, a user is assigned to only those roles on a need to know basis.  </li>
<li>Assurance for RBAC must be carried out using strict access control reviews. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong> 
 is a means of restricting access to information based on the identity of users and/or membership in certain groups. Access decisions are typically based on the authorizations granted to a user based on the credentials he presented at the time of authentication. The owner of information or any resource is able to change its permissions at his discretion. </p>
<p>Advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use </li>
<li>Easy to administer </li>
<li>Aligns to the principle of least privileges. </li>
<li>Object owner has total control over access granted </li>
</ul>
<p>Problems:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation of the roles and accesses has to be maintained stringently. </li>
<li>Multi-tenancy can not be implemented effectively unless there is a way to associate the roles with multi-tenancy capability requirements   </li>
<li>There is a tendency for scope creep to happen e.g. more accesses and privileges can be given than intended for. </li>
</ul>
<p>Areas of caution: </p>
<ul>
<li>While granting trusts </li>
<li>Assurance for DAC must be carried out using strict access control reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong> 
Ensures that the enforcement of organizational security policy does not rely on voluntary web application user compliance. MAC secures information by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of sensitivity a user is operating at.MAC is usually appropriate for extremely secure systems including multilevel secure military applications or mission critical data applications. </p>
<p>Advantages : </p>
<ul>
<li>Access to an object is based on the sensitivity of the object </li>
<li>Access based on need to know is strictly adhered to and scope creep has minimal possibility </li>
<li>Only an administrator can grant access </li>
</ul>
<p>Problems : </p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult and expensive to implement </li>
<li>Not agile </li>
</ul>
<p>Areas of caution : </p>
<ul>
<li>Classification and sensitivity assignment at an appropriate and pragmatic level </li>
<li>Assurance for MAC must be carried out to ensure that the classification of the objects is at the appropriate level. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permission Based Access Control</strong> 
Is the abstraction of application actions into a set of permissions. A permission may be represented simply as a string based name, for example "READ". Access decisions are made by checking if the current user has the permission associated with the requested application action. </p>
<p>The has relationship between the user and permission may be satisfied by creating a direct relationship between the user and permission (called a grant), or an indirect one. In the indirect model the permission grant is to an intermediate entity such as user group. </p>
<p>A user is considered a member of a user group if and only if the user inherits permissions from the user group.  Systems that provide fine-grained domain object level access control, permissions may be grouped into classes. The system can be associated with a class which determines the permissions applicable to the respective domain object. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In such a system a "DOCUMENT" class may be defined with the permissions "READ", "WRITE" and "DELETE"; a "SERVER" class may be defined with the permissions "START", "STOP", and "REBOOT".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>File Uploading</h2>
<p>Into web applications, when we expect upload of working documents from users, we can expose the application to submission of documents that we can categorize as malicious. 
We use the term "malicious" here to refer to documents that embed malicious code that will be executed when another user (admin, back office operator...) will open the document with the associated application reader.  <br />
Usually, when an application expect his user to upload a document, the application expect to receive a document for which the intended use will be for reading/printing/archiving. The document should not alter is content at opening time and should be in a final rendered state.</p>
<p>The most common file types used to transmit malicious code into file upload feature are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office document: Word/Excel/Powerpoint</li>
<li>Adobe PDF document: Insert malicious code as attachment.</li>
<li>Images: Malicious code embedded into the file or use of binary file with image file extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Word/Excel/Powerpoint/Pdf documents: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detect when a document contains "code"/OLE package, if it's the case then block the upload process.
For Images document:
Sanitize incoming image using re-writing approach and then disable/remove any "code" present (this approach also handle case in which the file sent is not an image).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload Verification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use input validation to ensure the uploaded filename uses an expected extension type</li>
<li>Ensure the uploaded file is not larger than a defined maximum file size</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upload Storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a new filename to store the file on the OS. Do not use any user controlled text for this filename or for the temporary filename.</li>
<li>Store all user uploaded files on a separate domain. Archives should be analyzed for malicious content (anti-malware, static analysis, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public Serving of Uploaded Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the image is served with the correct content-type (e.g. image/jpeg, application/x-xpinstall)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beware of "special" files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The upload feature should be using a whitelist approach to only allow specific file types and extensions. However, it is important to be aware of the following file types that, if allowed, could result in security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"crossdomain.xml" allows cross-domain data loading in Flash, Java and Silverlight. If permitted on sites with authentication this can permit cross-domain data theft and CSRF attacks. Note this can get pretty complicated depending on the specific plugin version in question, so its best to just prohibit files named "crossdomain.xml" or "clientaccesspolicy.xml".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>".htaccess" and ".htpasswd" provides server configuration options on a per-directory basis, and should not be permitted. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging and Error Handling</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose of logging</strong>
Application logging should be always be included for security events. Application logs are invaluable data for:</p>
<p>Identifying security incidents<br />
Monitoring policy violations  <br />
Establishing baselines<br />
Assisting non-repudiation controls<br />
Providing information about problems and unusual conditions 
Contributing additional application-specific data for incident investigation which is lacking in other log sources<br />
Helping defend against vulnerability identification and exploitation through attack detection   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each log entry needs to include sufficient information for the intended subsequent monitoring and analysis. It could be full content data, but is more likely to be an extract or just summary properties.</p>
<p>The application logs must record "when, where, who and what" for each event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Where to record event data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When using the file system, it is preferable to use a separate partition than those used by the operating system, other application files and user generated content<blockquote>
<p>For file-based logs, apply strict permissions concerning which users can access the directories, and the permissions of files within the directories
In web applications, the logs should not be exposed in web-accessible locations, and if done so, should have restricted access and be configured with a plain text MIME type (not HTML)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>When using a database, it is preferable to utilize a separate database account that is only used for writing log data and which has very restrictive database , table, function and command permissions</li>
<li>Use standard formats over secure protocols to record and send event data, or log files, to other systems e.g. Common Log File System (CLFS) or Common Event Format (CEF) over syslog; standard formats facilitate integration with centralised logging services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which events to log</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Input validation failures e.g. protocol violations, unacceptable encodings, invalid parameter names and values</li>
<li>Output validation failures e.g. database record set mismatch, invalid data encoding</li>
<li>Authentication successes and failures</li>
<li>Authorization (access control) failures</li>
<li>Session management failures e.g. cookie session identification value modification</li>
<li>Application errors and system events e.g. syntax and runtime errors, connectivity problems, performance issues, third party service error messages, file system errors, file upload virus detection, configuration changes</li>
<li>Application and related systems start-ups and shut-downs, and logging initialization (starting, stopping or pausing)</li>
<li>Use of higher-risk functionality e.g. network connections, addition or deletion of users, changes to privileges, assigning users to tokens, adding or deleting tokens, use of systems administrative privileges, access by application administrators,all actions by users with administrative privileges, access to payment cardholder data, use of data encrypting keys, key changes, creation and deletion of system-level objects, data import and export including screen-based reports, submission of user-generated content - especially file uploads.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data to exclude</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Application source code</li>
<li>Session identification values (consider replacing with a hashed value if needed to track session specific events)</li>
<li>Access tokens</li>
<li>Sensitive personal data and some forms of personally identifiable information (PII) e.g. health, government identifiers, vulnerable people</li>
<li>Authentication passwords</li>
<li>Database connection strings</li>
<li>Encryption keys and other master secrets</li>
<li>Bank account or payment card holder data</li>
<li>Data of a higher security classification than the logging system is allowed to store</li>
<li>Commercially-sensitive information</li>
<li>Information it is illegal to collect in the relevant jurisdictions</li>
<li>Information a user has opted out of collection, or not consented to e.g. use of do not track, or where consent to collect has expired</li>
</ul>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p><strong>User Facing Error Messages</strong><br />
Error messages displayed to the user should not contain system, diagnostic or debug information.</p>
<p><strong>Formatting Error Messages</strong></p>
<p>Error messages are often logged to text files or files viewed within a web browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>text based log files: Ensure any newline characters (%0A%0C) are appropriately handled to prevent log forging</li>
<li>web based log files: Ensure any logged html characters are appropriately encoded to prevent XSS when viewing logs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Error Handling Design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Log necessary error data to a system log file</li>
<li>Display a generic error message to the user</li>
<li>If necessary provide an error code to the user which maps to the error data in the logfile. A user reporting an error can provide this code to help diagnose issue</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Regular Updates</h2>
<p>Mobile devices and platforms, such as, for example, smartphones, typically provide the capability for operating system (OS), firmware (FW) and applications updates or re-installations with reduced user involvement. The user involvement may often be limited to clicking an icon or accepting an agreement. While this reduced level of involvement may provide convenience and an improved user experience, it fails to address the issue of secure user authentication.</p>
<p>Mobile devices and platforms, such as smartphones, typically provide features for operating system (OS), firmware (FW) upgrades, and applications or reinstallations with reduced user engagement. User engagement may be limited to clicking an icon or accepting a contract. While this reduced level of engagement can provide convenience and enhance the user experience, it does not address the issue of secure user authentication. Thus, it is necessary to create a secure channel that provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication and data updating.</p>
<p><strong> Requirements for a secure software update: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Confidentiality: the contents of transmitted data should be kept confidential. This also includes software updates. Thus, secure channels between the mobile device and the network manager must be set up. The standard approach to keep sensitive data secret is to encrypt the data with a key that is shared only between the intended receivers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integrity: it must be possible to ensure that data packets have not been modified in transit. For mobile devices, control requests, and software updates it is critically important to verify that the contents in the packets have not been tampered with;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Authentication: To prevent an attacker from injecting packets it is important to make sure that the receiver can verify the sender of the packets. Data authentication ensures this property such that the re- ceiver can verify that the received packets really are from the claimed sender. For example, for software updates, data authentication is needed such that the device can verify that the received software comes from a trusted source. Data authentication can be achieved using a MAC or Digital Signature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Freshness: to protect against replay attacks, e.g., during the key establishment phase, the proto- col must ensure that the messages are fresh. Data freshness ensures the security property that the data is recent and that an attacker is not replaying old data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third-Party Applications</h2>
<p>Many social networks also offer the possibility to create additional applications that extend the functionality of the network. The two major platforms for such applications are the Facebook Platform and Open Social. While applications designed for the Facebook Platform can only be executed in Facebook, Open Social is a combined effort to allow developers to run their applications on any social network that supports the Open Social platform (e.g., MySpace and Orkut).</p>
<p><strong> Requirements for a secure third-party applications: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Privacy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Authentication;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Authorization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that process or query sensitive information should run in a trusted and secure environment. To create this environment, the app can check the device for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIN - or password-protected device locking;</li>
<li>Recent Mobile Plataform or OS version;</li>
<li>USB Debugging activation;</li>
<li>Device encryption;</li>
<li>Device rooting (see also "Testing Root Detection").</li>
</ul>

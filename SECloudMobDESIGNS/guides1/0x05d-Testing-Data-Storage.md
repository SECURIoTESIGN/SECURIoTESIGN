## Data Storage on Android

Protecting authentication tokens, private information, and other sensitive data is key to mobile security. In this chapter, you will learn about the APIs Android offers for local data storage and best practices for using them.

The guidelines for saving data can be summarized quite easily: Public data should be available to everyone, but sensitive and private data must be protected, or, better yet, kept out of device storage.

Note that the meaning of "sensitive data" depends on the app that handles it. Data classification is described in detail in the "Identifying Sensitive Data" section of the chapter "Mobile App Security Testing."

Next to protecting sensitive data, you need to ensure that data read from any storage source is validated and possibly sanitized. The validation often does not go beyond ensuring that the data presented is of the type requested, but with using additional cryptographic controls, such as an HMAC, you can validate the correctness of the data.

### Testing Local Storage for Sensitive Data (MSTG-STORAGE-1 and MSTG-STORAGE-2)

#### Overview

Conventional wisdom suggests that as little sensitive data as possible should be stored on permanent local storage. In most practical scenarios, however, some type of user data must be stored. For example, asking the user to enter a very complex password every time the app starts isn't a great idea in terms of usability. Most apps must locally cache some kind of authentication token to avoid this. Personally identifiable information (PII) and other types of sensitive data may also be saved if a given scenario calls for it.

Sensitive data is vulnerable when it is not properly protected by the app that is persistently storing it. The app may be able to store the data in several places, for example, on the device or on an external SD card. When you're trying to exploit these kinds of issues, consider that a lot of information may be processed and stored in different locations. Identifying at the outset the kind of information processed by the mobile application and input by the user is important. Identifying information that may be valuable to attackers (e.g., passwords, credit card information, PII) is also important.

Disclosing sensitive information has several consequences, including decrypted information. In general, an attacker may identify this information and use it for additional attacks, such as social engineering (if PII has been disclosed), account hijacking (if session information or an authentication token has been disclosed), and gathering information from apps that have a payment option (to attack and abuse them).

[Storing data](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html "Storing Data in Android") is essential for many mobile apps. For example, some apps use data storage to keep track of user settings or user-provided data. Data can be stored persistently in several ways. The following list of storage techniques are widely used on the Android platform:

- Shared Preferences
- SQLite Databases
- Realm Databases
- Internal Storage
- External Storage

The following code snippets demonstrate bad practices that disclose sensitive information. They also illustrate Android storage mechanisms in detail. For more information, check out the [Security Tips for Storing Data](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html#StoringData "Security Tips for Storing Data") in the Android developer's guide.

##### Shared Preferences

The SharedPreferences API is commonly used to permanently save small collections of key-value pairs. Data stored in a SharedPreferences object is written to a plain-text XML file. The SharedPreferences object can be declared world-readable (accessible to all apps) or private.
Misuse of the SharedPreferences API can often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Consider the following example:

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getSharedPreferences("key", MODE_WORLD_READABLE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putString("username", "administrator");
editor.putString("password", "supersecret");
editor.commit();
```

Once the activity has been called, the file key.xml will be created with the provided data. This code violates several best practices.

- The username and password are stored in clear text in `/data/data/<package-name>/shared_prefs/key.xml`.

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' standalone='yes' ?>
<map>
  <string name="username">administrator</string>
  <string name="password">supersecret</string>
</map>
```

- `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` allows all applications to access and read the contents of `key.xml`.

```shell
root@hermes:/data/data/sg.vp.owasp_mobile.myfirstapp/shared_prefs # ls -la
-rw-rw-r-- u0_a118    170 2016-04-23 16:51 key.xml
```

> Please note that `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` and `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` were deprecated with API 17. Although newer devices may not be affected by this, applications compiled with an android:targetSdkVersion value less than 17 may be affected if they run on an OS version that was released before Android 4.2 (`JELLY_BEAN_MR1`).

##### SQLite Database (Unencrypted)

SQLite is an SQL database engine that stores data in `.db` files. The Android SDK has built-in support for SQLite databases. The main package used to manage the databases is `android.database.sqlite`.
You may use the following code to store sensitive information within an activity:

```java
SQLiteDatabase notSoSecure = openOrCreateDatabase("privateNotSoSecure",MODE_PRIVATE,null);
notSoSecure.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts(Username VARCHAR, Password VARCHAR);");
notSoSecure.execSQL("INSERT INTO Accounts VALUES('admin','AdminPass');");
notSoSecure.close();
```

Once the activity has been called, the database file `privateNotSoSecure` will be created with the provided data and stored in the clear text file `/data/data/<package-name>/databases/privateNotSoSecure`.

The database's directory may contain several files besides the SQLite database:

- [Journal files](https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html "SQLite Journal files"): These are temporary files used to implement atomic commit and rollback.
- [Lock files](https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html "SQLite Lock Files"): The lock files are part of the locking and journaling feature, which was designed to improve SQLite concurrency and reduce the writer starvation problem.

Sensitive information should not be stored in unencrypted SQLite databases.

##### SQLite Databases (Encrypted)

With the library [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/ "SQLCipher"), SQLite databases can be password-encrypted.

```java
SQLiteDatabase secureDB = SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase(database, "password123", null);
secureDB.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Accounts(Username VARCHAR,Password VARCHAR);");
secureDB.execSQL("INSERT INTO Accounts VALUES('admin','AdminPassEnc');");
secureDB.close();

```

If encrypted SQLite databases are used, determine whether the password is hard-coded in the source, stored in shared preferences, or hidden somewhere else in the code or filesystem.
Secure ways to retrieve the key include:

- Asking the user to decrypt the database with a PIN or password once the app is opened (weak passwords and PINs are vulnerable to brute force attacks)
- Storing the key on the server and allowing it to be accessed from a web service only (so that the app can be used only when the device is online)

##### Firebase Real-time Databases

Firebase is a development platform with more than 15 products, and one of them is Firebase Real-time Database. It can be leveraged by application developers to store and sync data with a NoSQL cloud-hosted database. The data is stored as JSON and is synchronized in real-time to every connected client and also remains available even when the application goes offline.

In Jan 2018, [Appthority Mobile Threat Team (MTT)](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/436053/Appthority%20Q2-2018%20MTR%20Unsecured%20Firebase%20Databases.pdf "Unsecured Firebase Databases: Exposing Sensitive Data via Thousands of Mobile Apps") performed security research on insecure backend services connecting to mobile applications. They discovered a misconfiguration in Firebase, which is one of the top 10 most popular data stores which could allow attackers to retrieve all the unprotected data hosted on the cloud server. The team performed the research on more than 2 Million mobile applications and found that the around 9% of Android applications and almost half (47%) of iOS apps that connect to a Firebase database were vulnerable.

The misconfigured Firebase instance can be identified by making the following network call:

`https://\<firebaseProjectName\>.firebaseio.com/.json`

The _firebaseProjectName_ can be retrieved from the mobile application by reverse engineering the application. Alternatively, the analysts can use [Firebase Scanner](https://github.com/shivsahni/FireBaseScanner "Firebase Scanner"), a python script that automates the task above as shown below:

```shell
python FirebaseScanner.py -p <pathOfAPKFile>

python FirebaseScanner.py -f <commaSeperatedFirebaseProjectNames>
```

##### Realm Databases

The [Realm Database for Java](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/ "Realm Database") is becoming more and more popular among developers. The database and its contents can be encrypted with a key stored in the configuration file.

```java
//the getKey() method either gets the key from the server or from a KeyStore, or is deferred from a password.
RealmConfiguration config = new RealmConfiguration.Builder()
  .encryptionKey(getKey())
  .build();

Realm realm = Realm.getInstance(config);

```

If the database is not encrypted, you should be able to obtain the data. If the database *is* encrypted, determine whether the key is hard-coded in the source or resources and whether it is stored unprotected in shared preferences or some other location.

##### Internal Storage

You can save files to the device's [internal storage](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal "Using Internal Storage"). Files saved to internal storage are containerized by default and cannot be accessed by other apps on the device. When the user uninstalls your app, these files are removed.
The following code would persistently store sensitive data to internal storage:

```java
FileOutputStream fos = null;
try {
   fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
   fos.write(test.getBytes());
   fos.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
}
```

You should check the file mode to make sure that only the app can access the file. You can set this access with `MODE_PRIVATE`. Modes such as `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` (deprecated) and `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` (deprecated) may pose a security risk.

Search for the class `FileInputStream` to find out which files are opened and read within the app.

##### External Storage

Every Android-compatible device supports [shared external storage](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal "Using External Storage"). This storage may be removable (such as an SD card) or internal (non-removable).
Files saved to external storage are world-readable. The user can modify them when USB mass storage is enabled.
You can use the following code to persistently store sensitive information to external storage as the contents of the file `password.txt`:

```java
File file = new File (Environment.getExternalFilesDir(), "password.txt");
String password = "SecretPassword";
FileOutputStream fos;
    fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
    fos.write(password.getBytes());
    fos.close();
```

The file will be created and the data will be stored in a clear text file in external storage once the activity has been called.

It's also worth knowing that files stored outside the application folder (`data/data/<package-name>/`) will not be deleted when the user uninstalls the application.
Finally, it's worth noting that the external storage can be used by an attacker to allow for arbitrary control of the application in some cases. For more information: [see the blog from Checkpoint](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2018/08/12/man-in-the-disk-a-new-attack-surface-for-android-apps/ "Man in the disk").

#### Static Analysis

##### Local Storage

As previously mentioned, there are several ways to store information on an Android device. You should therefore check several sources to determine the kind of storage used by the Android app and to find out whether the app processes sensitive data insecurely.

- Check `AndroidManifest.xml` for read/write external storage permissions, for example, `uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"`.
- Check the source code for keywords and API calls that are used to store data:
  - File permissions, such as:
    - `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` or `MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE`: You should avoid using `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` and `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` for files because any app will be able to read from or write to the files, even if they are stored in the app's private data directory. If data must be shared with other applications, consider a content provider. A content provider offers read and write permissions to other apps and can grant dynamic permission on a case-by-case basis.
  - Classes and functions, such as:
    - the `SharedPreferences` class ( stores key-value pairs)
    - the `FileOutPutStream` class (uses internal or external storage)
    - the `getExternal*` functions (use external storage)
    - the `getWritableDatabase` function (returns a SQLiteDatabase for writing)
    - the `getReadableDatabase` function (returns a SQLiteDatabase for reading)
    - the `getCacheDir` and `getExternalCacheDirs` function (use cached files)

Encryption should be implemented using proven SDK functions. The following describes bad practices to look for in the source code:

- Locally stored sensitive information "encrypted" via simple bit operations like XOR or bit flipping. These operations should be avoided because the encrypted data can be recovered easily.
- Keys used or created without Android onboard features, such as the Android KeyStore
- Keys disclosed by hard-coding

A typical misuse are hard-coded cryptographic keys. Hard-coded and world-readable cryptographic keys significantly increase the possibility that encrypted data will be recovered. Once an attacker obtains the data, decrypting it is trivial. Symmetric cryptography keys must be stored on the device, so identifying them is just a matter of time and effort. Consider the following code:

```Java
this.db = localUserSecretStore.getWritableDatabase("SuperPassword123");
```

Obtaining the key is trivial because it is contained in the source code and identical for all installations of the app. Encrypting data this way is not beneficial. Look for hard-coded API keys/private keys and other valuable data; they pose a similar risk. Encoded/encrypted keys represent another attempt to make it harder but not impossible to get the crown jewels.

Consider the following code:

```Java
//A more complicated effort to store the XOR'ed halves of a key (instead of the key itself)
private static final String[] myCompositeKey = new String[]{
  "oNQavjbaNNSgEqoCkT9Em4imeQQ=","3o8eFOX4ri/F8fgHgiy/BS47"
};
```

The algorithm for decoding the original key might be something like this:

```Java
public void useXorStringHiding(String myHiddenMessage) {
  byte[] xorParts0 = Base64.decode(myCompositeKey[0],0);
  byte[] xorParts1 = Base64.decode(myCompositeKey[1],0);

  byte[] xorKey = new byte[xorParts0.length];
  for(int i = 0; i < xorParts1.length; i++){
    xorKey[i] = (byte) (xorParts0[i] ^ xorParts1[i]);
  }
  HidingUtil.doHiding(myHiddenMessage.getBytes(), xorKey, false);
}
```

Verify common locations of secrets:

- resources (typically at res/values/strings.xml)
  Example:

  ```xml
  <resources>
      <string name="app_name">SuperApp</string>
      <string name="hello_world">Hello world!</string>
      <string name="action_settings">Settings</string>
      <string name="secret_key">My_Secret_Key</string>
    </resources>
  ```

- build configs, such as in local.properties or gradle.properties
  Example:

  ```groovy
  buildTypes {
    debug {
      minifyEnabled true
      buildConfigField "String", "hiddenPassword", "\"${hiddenPassword}\""
    }
  }
  ```

##### KeyStore

The [Android KeyStore](https://www.androidauthority.com/use-android-keystore-store-passwords-sensitive-information-623779/ "Use Android KeyStore") supports relatively secure credential storage. As of Android 4.3, it provides public APIs for storing and using app-private keys. An app can use a public key to create a new private/public key pair for encrypting application secrets, and it can decrypt the secrets with the private key.

You can protect keys stored in the Android KeyStore with user authentication in a confirm credential flow. The user's lock screen credentials (pattern, PIN, password, or fingerprint) are used for authentication.

You can use stored keys in one of two modes:

1. Users are authorized to use keys for a limited period of time after authentication. In this mode, all keys can be used as soon as the user unlocks the device. You can customize the period of authorization for each key. You can use this option only if the secure lock screen is enabled. If the user disables the secure lock screen, all stored keys will become permanently invalid.

2. Users are authorized to use a specific cryptographic operation that is associated with one key. In this mode, users must request a separate authorization for each operation that involves the key. Currently, fingerprint authentication is the only way to request such authorization.

The level of security afforded by the Android KeyStore depends on its implementation, which depends on the device. Most modern devices offer a hardware-backed KeyStore implementation: keys are generated and used in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or a Secure Element (SE), and the operating system can't access them directly. This means that the encryption keys themselves can't be easily retrieved, even from a rooted device. You can determine whether the keys are inside the secure hardware by checking the return value of the `isInsideSecureHardware` method, which is part of the [`KeyInfo` class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyInfo.html "Class KeyInfo"). Note that the relevant KeyInfo indicates that secret keys and HMAC keys are insecurely stored on several devices despite private keys being correctly stored on the secure hardware.

The keys of a software-only implementation are encrypted with a [per-user encryption master key](https://nelenkov.blogspot.sg/2013/08/credential-storage-enhancements-android-43.html "Nikolay Elenvok - Credential storage enhancements in Android 4.3"). An attacker can access all keys stored on rooted devices that have this implementation in the folder `/data/misc/keystore/`. Because the user's lock screen pin/password is used to generate the master key, the Android KeyStore is unavailable when the device is locked.

##### Older KeyStore Implementations

Older Android versions don't include KeyStore, but they *do* include the KeyStore interface from JCA (Java Cryptography Architecture). You can use KeyStores that implement this interface to ensure the secrecy and integrity of keys stored with KeyStore; BouncyCastle KeyStore (BKS) is recommended. All implementations are based on the fact that files are stored on the filesystem; all files are password-protected.
To create one, you can use the `KeyStore.getInstance("BKS", "BC") method`, where "BKS" is the KeyStore name (BouncyCastle Keystore) and "BC" is the provider (BouncyCastle). You can also use SpongyCastle as a wrapper and initialize the KeyStore as follows: `KeyStore.getInstance("BKS", "SC")`.

Be aware that not all KeyStores properly protect the keys stored in the KeyStore files.

##### KeyChain

The [KeyChain class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyChain.html "Android KeyChain") is used to store and retrieve *system-wide* private keys and their corresponding certificates (chain). The user will be prompted to set a lock screen pin or password to protect the credential storage if something is being imported into the KeyChain for the first time. Note that the KeyChain is system-wide—every application can access the materials stored in the KeyChain.

Inspect the source code to determine whether native Android mechanisms identify sensitive information. Sensitive information should be encrypted, not stored in clear text. For sensitive information that must be stored on the device, several API calls are available to protect the data via the `KeyChain` class. Complete the following steps:

- Make sure that the app is using the Android KeyStore and Cipher mechanisms to securely store encrypted information on the device. Look for the patterns `AndroidKeystore`, `import java.security.KeyStore`, `import javax.crypto.Cipher`, `import java.security.SecureRandom`, and corresponding usages.
- Use the `store(OutputStream stream, char[] password)` function to store the KeyStore to disk with a password. Make sure that the password is provided by the user, not hard-coded.

##### Third Party libraries

There are several different open-source libraries that offer encryption capabilities specific for the Android platform.

- **[Java AES Crypto](https://github.com/tozny/java-aes-crypto "Java AES Crypto")** - A simple Android class for encrypting and decrypting strings.
- **[SQL Cipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/ "SQL Cipher")** - SQLCipher is an open source extension to SQLite that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files.
- **[Secure Preferences](https://github.com/scottyab/secure-preferences "Secure Preferences")** - Android Shared preference wrapper than encrypts the keys and values of Shared Preferences.

> Please keep in mind that as long as the key is not stored in the KeyStore, it is always possible to easily retrieve the key on a rooted device and then decrypt the values you are trying to protect.

#### Dynamic Analysis

Install and use the app, executing all functions at least once. Data can be generated when entered by the user, sent by the endpoint, or shipped with the app. Then complete the following:

- Identify development files, backup files, and old files that shouldn't be included with a production release.
- Determine whether SQLite databases are available and whether they contain sensitive information. SQLite databases are stored in `/data/data/<package-name>/databases`.
- Check Shared Preferences that are stored as XML files (in `/data/data/<package-name>/shared_prefs`) for sensitive information. Avoid using Shared Preferences and other mechanisms that can't protect data when you are storing sensitive information. Shared Preferences is insecure and unencrypted by default. You can use [secure-preferences](https://github.com/scottyab/secure-preferences "Secure-preferences encrypts the values of Shared Preferences") to encrypt the values stored in Shared Preferences, but the Android KeyStore should be your first choice for storing data securely.
- Check the permissions of the files in `/data/data/<package-name>`. Only the user and group created when you installed the app (e.g., u0_a82) should have user read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`). Other users should not have permission to access files, but they may have execute permissions for directories.
- Determine whether a Realm database is available in `/data/data/<package-name>/files/`, whether it is unencrypted, and whether it contains sensitive information. By default, the file extension is `realm` and the file name is `default`. Inspect the Realm database with the [Realm Browser](https://github.com/realm/realm-browser-osx "Realm Browser for macOS").
- Check external storage for data. Don't use external storage for sensitive data because it is readable and writeable system-wide.

Files saved to internal storage are by default private to your application; neither the user nor other applications can access them. When users uninstall your application, these files are removed.

### Testing Local Storage for Input Validation (MSTG-PLATFORM-2)

For any publicly accessible data storage, any process can override the data. This means that input validation needs to be applied the moment the data is read back again.

> Note: Similar holds for private accessible data on a rooted device

#### Static analysis

##### Using Shared Preferences

When you use the `SharedPreferences.Editor` to read or write int/boolean/long values, you cannot check whether the data is overridden or not. However: it can hardly be used for actual attacks other than chaining the values (e.g. no additional exploits can be packed which will take over the control flow). In the case of a `String` or a `StringSet` you should be careful with how the data is interpreted.
Using reflection based persistence? Check the section on "Testing Object Persistence" for Android to see how it should be validated.
Using the `SharedPreferences.Editor` to store and read certificates or keys? Make sure you have patched your security provider given vulnerabilities such as found in [Bouncy Castle](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000613/ "Key reading vulnerability due to unsafe reflection").

In all cases, having the content HMACed can help to ensure that no additions and/or changes have been applied.

##### Using Other Storage Mechanisms

In case other public storage mechanisms (than the `SharedPreferences.Editor`) are used, the data needs to be validated the moment it is read from the storage mechanism.

### Testing Logs for Sensitive Data (MSTG-STORAGE-3)

#### Overview

There are many legitimate reasons to create log files on a mobile device, such as keeping track of crashes, errors, and usage statistics. Log files can be stored locally when the app is offline and sent to the endpoint once the app is online. However, logging sensitive data may expose the data to attackers or malicious applications, and it violates user confidentiality.
You can create log files in several ways. The following list includes two classes that are available for Android:

- [Log Class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html "Log Class")
- [Logger Class](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/logging/Logger.html "Logger Class")

Use a centralized logging class and mechanism and remove logging statements from the production release because other applications may be able to read them.

#### Static Analysis

You should check the apps' source code for logging mechanisms by searching for the following keywords:

- Functions and classes, such as:
  - `android.util.Log`
  - `Log.d` | `Log.e` | `Log.i` | `Log.v` | `Log.w` | `Log.wtf`
  - `Logger`

- Keywords and system output:
  - `System.out.print` | `System.err.print`
  - logfile
  - logging
  - logs

While preparing the production release, you can use tools like `ProGuard` (included in Android Studio). [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard "ProGuard") is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier. It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes and can also be used to delete logging-related code.

To determine whether all the `android.util.Log` class' logging functions have been removed, check the ProGuard configuration file (_proguard-project.txt_) for the following options:

```java
-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log
{
  public static boolean isLoggable(java.lang.String, int);
  public static int v(...);
  public static int i(...);
  public static int w(...);
  public static int d(...);
  public static int e(...);
  public static int wtf(...);
}
```

Note that the example above only ensures that calls to the Log class' methods will be removed. If the string that will be logged is dynamically constructed, the code that constructs the string may remain in the bytecode. For example, the following code issues an implicit `StringBuilder` to construct the log statement:

```java
Log.v("Private key [byte format]: " + key);
```

The compiled bytecode, however, is equivalent to the bytecode of the following log statement, which constructs the string explicitly:

```java
Log.v(new StringBuilder("Private key [byte format]: ").append(key.toString()).toString());
```

ProGuard guarantees removal of the `Log.v` method call. Whether the rest of the code (`new StringBuilder ...`) will be removed depends on the complexity of the code and the [ProGuard version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6009078/removing-unused-strings-during-proguard-optimisation "Removing unused strings during ProGuard optimization ").

This is a security risk because the (unused) string leaks plain text data into memory, which can be accessed via a debugger or memory dumping.

Unfortunately, no silver bullet exists for this issue, but one option would be to implement a custom logging facility that takes simple arguments and constructs the log statements internally.

```java
SecureLog.v("Private key [byte format]: ", key);
```

Then configure ProGuard to strip its calls.

#### Dynamic Analysis

Use all the mobile app functions at least once, then identify the application's data directory and look for log files (`/data/data/<package-name>`). Check the application logs to determine whether log data has been generated; some mobile applications create and store their own logs in the data directory.  

Many application developers still use `System.out.println` or `printStackTrace` instead of a proper logging class. Therefore, your testing strategy must include all output generated while the application is starting, running and closing. To determine what data is directly printed by `System.out.println` or `printStackTrace`, you can use [`Logcat`](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-log.html "Debugging with Logcat") as explained in the chapter "Basic Security Testing", section "Monitoring System Logs".

Remember that you can target a specific app by filtering the Logcat output as follows:

```shell
$ adb logcat | grep "$(adb shell ps | grep <package-name> | awk '{print $2}')"
```

> If you already know the app PID you may give it directly using `--pid` flag.

You may also want to apply further filters or regular expressions (using `logcat`'s regex flags `-e <expr>, --regex=<expr>` for example) if you expect certain strings or patterns to come up in the logs.

### Determining Whether Sensitive Data is Sent to Third Parties (MSTG-STORAGE-4)

#### Overview

You can embed third-party services in apps. These services can implement tracker services, monitor user behavior, sell banner advertisements, improve the user experience, and more.

The downside is a lack of visibility: you can't know exactly what code third-party libraries execute. Consequently, you should make sure that only necessary, non-sensitive information will be sent to the service.

Most third-party services are implemented in one of two ways:

- With a standalone library, such as an Android project Jar that is included in the APK
- With a full SDK

#### Static Analysis

You can automatically integrate third-party libraries into apps by using an IDE wizard or manually adding a library or SDK. In either case, review the permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. In particular, you should determine whether permissions for accessing `SMS (READ_SMS)`, contacts (`READ_CONTACTS`), and location (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`) are really necessary (see `Testing App Permissions`). Developers should check the source code for changes after the library has been added to the project.

Check the source code for API calls and third-party library functions or SDKs. Review code changes for security best practices.

Review loaded libraries to determine whether they are necessary and whether they are out of date or contain known vulnerabilities.

All data sent to third-party services should be anonymized. Data (such as application IDs) that can be traced to a user account or session should not be sent to a third party.  

#### Dynamic Analysis

Check all requests to external services for embedded sensitive information.
To intercept traffic between the client and server, you can perform dynamic analysis by launching a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack with _Burp Suite Professional_ or _OWASP ZAP_. Once you route the traffic through the interception proxy, you can try to sniff the traffic that passes between the app and server. All app requests that aren't sent directly to the server on which the main function is hosted should be checked for sensitive information, such as PII in a tracker or ad service.

### Determining Whether the Keyboard Cache Is Disabled for Text Input Fields (MSTG-STORAGE-5)

#### Overview

When users type in input fields, the software automatically suggests data. This feature can be very useful for messaging apps. However, the keyboard cache may disclose sensitive information when the user selects an input field that takes this type of information.

#### Static Analysis

In the layout definition of an activity, you can define `TextViews` that have XML attributes. If the XML attribute `android:inputType` is given the value `textNoSuggestions`, the keyboard cache will not be shown when the input field is selected. The user will have to type everything manually.

```xml
   <EditText
        android:id="@+id/KeyBoardCache"
        android:inputType="textNoSuggestions"/>
```

The code for all input fields that take sensitive information should include this XML attribute to [disable the keyboard suggestions](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/InputType.html#TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS "Disable keyboard suggestions"):

#### Dynamic Analysis

Start the app and click in the input fields that take sensitive data. If strings are suggested, the keyboard cache has not been disabled for these fields.

### Determining Whether Sensitive Stored Data Has Been Exposed via IPC Mechanisms (MSTG-STORAGE-6)

#### Overview

As part of Android's IPC mechanisms, content providers allow an app's stored data to be accessed and modified by other apps. If not properly configured, these mechanisms may leak sensitive data.

#### Static Analysis

The first step is to look at `AndroidManifest.xml` to detect content providers exposed by the app. You can identify content providers by the `<provider>` element. Complete the following steps:

- Determine whether the value of the export tag is "true" (`android:exported="true"`). Even if it is not, the tag will be set to "true" automatically if an `<intent-filter>` has been defined for the tag. If the content is meant to be accessed only by the app itself, set `android:exported` to "false." If not, set the flag to "true" and define proper read/write permissions.
- Determine whether the data is being protected by a permission tag (`android:permission`). Permission tags limit exposure to other apps.
- Determine whether the `android:protectionLevel` attribute has the value `signature`. This setting indicates that the data is intended to be accessed only by apps from the same enterprise (i.e., signed with the same key). To make the data accessible to other apps, apply a security policy with the `<permission>` element and set a proper `android:protectionLevel`. If you use `android:permission`, other applications must declare corresponding `<uses-permission>` elements in their manifests to interact with your content provider. You can use the `android:grantUriPermissions` attribute to grant more specific access to other apps; you can limit access with the `<grant-uri-permission>` element.

Inspect the source code to understand how the content provider is meant to be used. Search for the following keywords:

- `android.content.ContentProvider`
- `android.database.Cursor`
- `android.database.sqlite`
- `.query`
- `.update`
- `.delete`

> To avoid SQL injection attacks within the app, use parameterized query methods, such as `query`, `update`, and `delete`. Be sure to properly sanitize all method arguments; for example, the `selection` argument could lead to SQL injection if it is made up of concatenated user input.

 If you expose a content provider, determine whether parameterized [query methods](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider.html#query%28android.net.Uri%2C%20java.lang.String[]%2C%20java.lang.String%2C%20java.lang.String[]%2C%20java.lang.String%29 "Query method in Content Provider Class") (`query`, `update`, and `delete`) are being used to prevent SQL injection. If so, make sure all their arguments are properly sanitized.

We will use the vulnerable password manager app [Sieve](https://github.com/mwrlabs/drozer/releases/download/2.3.4/sieve.apk "Sieve - Vulnerable Password Manager") as an example of a vulnerable content provider.

##### Inspect the Android Manifest

Identify all defined `<provider>` elements:

```xml
<provider android:authorities="com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider" android:exported="true" android:multiprocess="true" android:name=".DBContentProvider">
    <path-permission android:path="/Keys" android:readPermission="com.mwr.example.sieve.READ_KEYS" android:writePermission="com.mwr.example.sieve.WRITE_KEYS"/>
</provider>
<provider android:authorities="com.mwr.example.sieve.FileBackupProvider" android:exported="true" android:multiprocess="true" android:name=".FileBackupProvider"/>
```

As shown in the `AndroidManifest.xml` above, the application exports two content providers. Note that one path ("/Keys") is protected by read and write permissions.

##### Inspect the source code

Inspect the `query` function in the `DBContentProvider.java` file to determine whether any sensitive information is being leaked:

```java
public Cursor query(final Uri uri, final String[] array, final String s, final String[] array2, final String s2) {
    final int match = this.sUriMatcher.match(uri);
    final SQLiteQueryBuilder sqLiteQueryBuilder = new SQLiteQueryBuilder();
    if (match >= 100 && match < 200) {
        sqLiteQueryBuilder.setTables("Passwords");
    }
    else if (match >= 200) {
        sqLiteQueryBuilder.setTables("Key");
    }
    return sqLiteQueryBuilder.query(this.pwdb.getReadableDatabase(), array, s, array2, (String)null, (String)null, s2);
}
```

Here we see that there are actually two paths, "/Keys" and "/Passwords", and the latter is not being protected in the manifest and is therefore vulnerable.

 When accessing a URI, the query statement returns all passwords and the path `Passwords/`. We will address this in the "Dynamic Analysis" section and show the exact URI that is required.

#### Dynamic Analysis

##### Testing Content Providers

To dynamically analyze an application's content providers, first enumerate the attack surface: pass the app's package name to the Drozer module `app.provider.info`:

```shell
dz> run app.provider.info -a com.mwr.example.sieve
  Package: com.mwr.example.sieve
  Authority: com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider
  Read Permission: null
  Write Permission: null
  Content Provider: com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider
  Multiprocess Allowed: True
  Grant Uri Permissions: False
  Path Permissions:
  Path: /Keys
  Type: PATTERN_LITERAL
  Read Permission: com.mwr.example.sieve.READ_KEYS
  Write Permission: com.mwr.example.sieve.WRITE_KEYS
  Authority: com.mwr.example.sieve.FileBackupProvider
  Read Permission: null
  Write Permission: null
  Content Provider: com.mwr.example.sieve.FileBackupProvider
  Multiprocess Allowed: True
  Grant Uri Permissions: False
```

In this example, two content providers are exported. Both can be accessed without permission, except for the `/Keys` path in the `DBContentProvider`. With this information, you can reconstruct part of the content URIs to access the `DBContentProvider` (the URIs begin with `content://`).

To identify content provider URIs within the application, use Drozer's `scanner.provider.finduris` module. This module guesses paths and determines accessible content URIs in several ways:

```shell
dz> run scanner.provider.finduris -a com.mwr.example.sieve
Scanning com.mwr.example.sieve...
Unable to Query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/
...
Unable to Query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Keys
Accessible content URIs:
content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Keys/
content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords
content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/
```

Once you have a list of accessible content providers, try to extract data from each provider with the `app.provider.query` module:

```shell
dz> run app.provider.query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/ --vertical
_id: 1
service: Email
username: incognitoguy50
password: PSFjqXIMVa5NJFudgDuuLVgJYFD+8w== (Base64 - encoded)
email: incognitoguy50@gmail.com
```

You can also use Drozer to insert, update, and delete records from a vulnerable content provider:

- Insert record

  ```shell
  dz> run app.provider.insert content://com.vulnerable.im/messages
                  --string date 1331763850325
                  --string type 0
                  --integer _id 7
  ```

- Update record

  ```shell
  dz> run app.provider.update content://settings/secure
                  --selection "name=?"
                  --selection-args assisted_gps_enabled
                  --integer value 0
  ```

- Delete record

  ```shell
  dz> run app.provider.delete content://settings/secure
                  --selection "name=?"
                  --selection-args my_setting
  ```

##### SQL Injection in Content Providers

The Android platform promotes SQLite databases for storing user data. Because these databases are based on SQL, they may be vulnerable to SQL injection. You can use the Drozer module `app.provider.query` to test for SQL injection by manipulating the projection and selection fields that are passed to the content provider:

```shell
dz> run app.provider.query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/ --projection "'"
unrecognized token: "' FROM Passwords" (code 1): , while compiling: SELECT ' FROM Passwords

dz> run app.provider.query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/ --selection "'"
unrecognized token: "')" (code 1): , while compiling: SELECT * FROM Passwords WHERE (')
```

If an application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, it will return a verbose error message. SQL Injection on Android may be used to modify or query data from the vulnerable content provider. In the following example, the Drozer module `app.provider.query` is used to list all the database tables:

```shell
dz> run app.provider.query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/ --projection "*
FROM SQLITE_MASTER WHERE type='table';--"
| type  | name             | tbl_name         | rootpage | sql              |
| table | android_metadata | android_metadata | 3        | CREATE TABLE ... |
| table | Passwords        | Passwords        | 4        | CREATE TABLE ... |
| table | Key              | Key              | 5        | CREATE TABLE ... |
```

SQL Injection may also be used to retrieve data from otherwise protected tables:

```shell
dz> run app.provider.query content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/ --projection "* FROM Key;--"
| Password | pin |
| thisismypassword | 9876 |
```

You can automate these steps with the `scanner.provider.injection` module, which automatically finds vulnerable content providers within an app:

```shell
dz> run scanner.provider.injection -a com.mwr.example.sieve
Scanning com.mwr.example.sieve...
Injection in Projection:
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Keys/
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/
Injection in Selection:
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Keys/
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.DBContentProvider/Passwords/
```

##### File System Based Content Providers

Content providers can provide access to the underlying filesystem. This allows apps to share files (the Android sandbox normally prevents this). You can use the Drozer modules `app.provider.read` and `app.provider.download` to read and download files, respectively, from exported file-based content providers. These content providers are susceptible to directory traversal, which allows otherwise protected files in the target application's sandbox to be read.

```shell
dz> run app.provider.download content://com.vulnerable.app.FileProvider/../../../../../../../../data/data/com.vulnerable.app/database.db /home/user/database.db
Written 24488 bytes
```

Use the `scanner.provider.traversal` module to automate the process of finding content providers that are susceptible to directory traversal:

```shell
dz> run scanner.provider.traversal -a com.mwr.example.sieve
Scanning com.mwr.example.sieve...
Vulnerable Providers:
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.FileBackupProvider/
  content://com.mwr.example.sieve.FileBackupProvider
```

Note that `adb` can also be used to query content providers:

```shell
$ adb shell content query --uri content://com.owaspomtg.vulnapp.provider.CredentialProvider/credentials
Row: 0 id=1, username=admin, password=StrongPwd
Row: 1 id=2, username=test, password=test
...
```

### Checking for Sensitive Data Disclosure Through the User Interface (MSTG-STORAGE-7)

#### Overview

Many apps require users to enter several kinds of data to, for example, register an account or make a payment. Sensitive data may be exposed if the app doesn't properly mask it, when displaying data in clear text.

Masking of sensitive data, by showing asterisk or dots instead of clear text should be enforced within an app's activity to prevent disclosure and mitigate risks such as shoulder surfing.

#### Static Analysis

To make sure an application is masking sensitive user input, check for the following attribute in the definition of EditText:

```xml
android:inputType="textPassword"
```

With this setting, dots (instead of the input characters) will be displayed in the text field, preventing the app from leaking passwords or pins to the user interface.

#### Dynamic Analysis

To determine whether the application leaks any sensitive information to the user interface, run the application and identify components that either show such information or take it as input.

If the information is masked by, for example, replacing input with asterisks or dots, the app isn't leaking data to the user interface.

### Testing Backups for Sensitive Data (MSTG-STORAGE-8)

#### Overview

Like other modern mobile operating systems, Android offers auto-backup features. The backups usually include copies of data and settings for all installed apps. Whether sensitive user data stored by the app may leak to those data backups is an obvious concern.

Given its diverse ecosystem, Android supports many backup options:

- Stock Android has built-in USB backup facilities. When USB debugging is enabled, you can use the `adb backup` command to create full data backups and backups of an app's data directory.

- Google provides a "Back Up My Data" feature that backs up all app data to Google's servers.

- Two Backup APIs are available to app developers:

  - [Key/Value Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.html "Key/Value Backup") (Backup API or Android Backup Service) uploads to the Android Backup Service cloud.

  - [Auto Backup for Apps](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html "Auto Backup for Apps"): With Android 6.0 (>= API level 23), Google added the "Auto Backup for Apps feature." This feature automatically syncs at most 25MB of app data with the user's Google Drive account.

- OEMs may provide additional options. For example, HTC devices have a "HTC Backup" option that performs daily backups to the cloud when activated.

#### Static Analysis

##### Local

Android provides an attribute called [`allowBackup`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#allowbackup "allowBackup attribute") to back up all your application data. This attribute is set in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. If the value of this attribute is **true**, the device allows users to back up the application with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) via the command `$ adb backup`.

To prevent the app data backup, set the `android:allowBackup` attribute to **false**. When this attribute is unavailable, the allowBackup setting is enabled by default, and backup must be manually deactivated.

> Note: If the device was encrypted, then the backup files will be encrypted as well.

Check the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the following flag:

```xml
android:allowBackup="true"
```

If the flag value is **true**, determine whether the app saves any kind of sensitive data (check the test case "Testing for Sensitive Data in Local Storage").

##### Cloud

Regardless of  whether you use key/value backup or auto backup, you must determine the following:

- which files are sent to the cloud (e.g., SharedPreferences)
- whether the files contain sensitive information
- whether sensitive information is encrypted before being sent to the cloud.

> If you don't want to share files with Google Cloud, you can exclude them from [Auto Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html#IncludingFiles "Exclude files from Auto Backup"). Sensitive information stored at rest on the device should be encrypted before being sent to the cloud.

- **Auto Backup**: You configure Auto Backup via the boolean attribute `android:allowBackup` within the application's manifest file. [Auto Backup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html#EnablingAutoBackup "Enabling AutoBackup") is enabled by default for applications that target Android 6.0 (API Level 23). You can use the attribute `android:fullBackupOnly` to activate auto backup when implementing a backup agent, but this attribute is available for Android versions 6.0 and above only. Other Android versions use key/value backup instead.

```xml
android:fullBackupOnly
```

Auto backup includes almost all the app files and stores up 25 MB of them per app in the user's Google Drive account. Only the most recent backup is stored; the previous backup is deleted.

- **Key/Value Backup**: To enable key/value backup, you must define the backup agent in the manifest file. Look in `AndroidManifest.xml` for the following attribute:

```xml
android:backupAgent
```

To implement key/value backup, extend one of the following classes:

- [BackupAgent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/backup/BackupAgent.html "BackupAgent")
- [BackupAgentHelper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/backup/BackupAgentHelper.html "BackupAgentHelper")

To check for key/value backup implementations, look for these classes in the source code.

#### Dynamic Analysis

After executing all available app functions, attempt to back up via `adb`. If the backup is successful, inspect the backup archive for sensitive data. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
$ adb backup -apk -nosystem <package-name>
```

ADB should respond now with "Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation" and you should be asked on the Android phone for a password. This is an optional step and you don't need to provide one. If the phone does not prompt this message, try the following command including the quotes:

```shell
$ adb backup "-apk -nosystem <package-name>"
```

The problem happens when your device has an adb version prior to 1.0.31. If that's the case you must use an adb version of 1.0.31 also on your host machine. Versions of adb after 1.0.32 [broke the backwards compatibility.](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37096097 "adb backup is broken since ADB version 1.0.32")

Approve the backup from your device by selecting the _Back up my data_ option. After the backup process is finished, the file _.ab_ will be in your working directory.
Run the following command to convert the .ab file to tar.

```shell
$ dd if=mybackup.ab bs=24 skip=1|openssl zlib -d > mybackup.tar
```

In case you get the error `openssl:Error: 'zlib' is an invalid command.` you can try to use Python instead.

```shell
$ dd if=backup.ab bs=1 skip=24 | python -c "import zlib,sys;sys.stdout.write(zlib.decompress(sys.stdin.read()))" > backup.tar
```

The [_Android Backup Extractor_](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor "Android Backup Extractor") is another alternative backup tool. To make the tool to work, you have to download the Oracle JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files for [JRE7](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html "Oracle JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files JRE7") or [JRE8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html "Oracle JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files JRE8") and place them in the JRE lib/security folder. Run the following command to convert the tar file:

```shell
$ java -jar abe.jar unpack backup.ab
```

if it shows some Cipher information and usage, which means it hasn't unpacked successfully. In this case you can give a try with more arguments:

```shell
$ abe [-debug] [-useenv=yourenv] unpack <backup.ab> <backup.tar> [password]
```

[password]: is the password when your android device asked you earlier. For example here is: 123

```shell
$ java -jar abe.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar 123
```

Extract the tar file to your working directory.

```shell
$ tar xvf mybackup.tar
```

### Finding Sensitive Information in Auto-Generated Screenshots (MSTG-STORAGE-9)

#### Overview

Manufacturers want to provide device users with an aesthetically pleasing experience at application startup and exit, so they introduced the screenshot-saving feature for use when the application is backgrounded. This feature may pose a security risk. Sensitive data may be exposed if the user deliberately screenshots the application while sensitive data is displayed. A malicious application that is running on the device and able to continuously capture the screen may also expose data. Screenshots are written to local storage, from which they may be recovered by a rogue application (if the device is rooted) or someone who has stolen the device.

For example, capturing a screenshot of a banking application may reveal information about the user's account, credit, transactions, and so on.

#### Static Analysis

 A screenshot of the current activity is taken when an Android app goes into background and displayed for aesthetic purposes when the app returns to the foreground. However, this may leak sensitive information.

To determine whether the application may expose sensitive information via the app switcher, find out whether the [`FLAG_SECURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html#FLAG_SECURE "FLAG_SECURE Option") option has been set. You should find something similar to the following code snippet:

```Java
getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE,
                WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE);

setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
```

If the option has not been set, the application is vulnerable to screen capturing.

#### Dynamic Analysis

While black-box testing the app, navigate to any screen that contains sensitive information and click the home button to send the app to the background, then press the app switcher button to see the snapshot. As shown below, if `FLAG_SECURE` is set (right image), the snapshot will be empty; if the flag has not been set (left image), activity information will be shown:

| `FLAG_SECURE` not set  | `FLAG_SECURE` set  |
|---|---|
| ![OMTG_DATAST_010_1_FLAG_SECURE](Images/Chapters/0x05d/1.png)   |  ![OMTG_DATAST_010_2_FLAG_SECURE](Images/Chapters/0x05d/2.png) |

### Checking Memory for Sensitive Data (MSTG-STORAGE-10)

#### Overview

Analyzing memory can help developers identify the root causes of several problems, such as application crashes. However, it can also be used to access sensitive data. This section describes how to check for data disclosure via process memory.

First identify sensitive information that is stored in memory. Sensitive assets have likely been loaded into memory at some point. The objective is to verify that this information is exposed as briefly as possible.

To investigate an application's memory, you must first create a memory dump. You can also analyze the memory in real-time, e.g., via a debugger. Regardless of your approach, memory dumping is a very error-prone process in terms of verification because each dump contains the output of executed functions. You may miss executing critical scenarios. In addition, overlooking data during analysis is probable unless you know the data's footprint (either the exact value or the data format). For example, if the app encrypts with a randomly generated symmetric key, you likely won't be able to spot it in memory unless you can recognize the key's value in another context.

Therefore, you are better off starting with static analysis.

#### Static Analysis

For an overview of possible sources of data exposure, check the documentation and identify application components before you examine the source code. For example, sensitive data from a backend may be in the HTTP client, the XML parser, etc. You want all these copies to be removed from memory as soon as possible.

In addition, understanding the application's architecture and the architecture's role in the system will help you identify sensitive information that doesn't have to be exposed in memory at all. For example, assume your app receives data from one server and transfers it to another without any processing. That data can be handled in an encrypted format, which prevents exposure in memory.

However, if you need to expose sensitive data in memory, you should make sure that your app is designed to expose as few data copies as possible as briefly as possible. In other words, you want the handling of sensitive data to be centralized (i.e., with as few components as possible) and based on primitive, mutable data structures.

The latter requirement gives developers direct memory access. Make sure that they use this access to overwrite the sensitive data with dummy data (typically zeroes). Examples of preferable data types include `byte []` and `char []`, but not `String` or `BigInteger`. Whenever you try to modify an immutable object like `String`, you create and change a copy of the object.

Using non-primitive mutable types like `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` may be acceptable, but it's indicative and requires care. Types like `StringBuffer` are used to modify content (which is what you want to do). To access such a type's value, however, you would use the `toString` method, which would create an immutable copy of the data. There are several ways to use these data types without creating an immutable copy, but they require more effort than simply using a primitive array. Safe memory management is one benefit of using types like `StringBuffer` , but this can be a two-edged sword. If you try to modify the content of one of these types and the copy exceeds the buffer capacity, the buffer size will automatically increase. The buffer content may be copied to a different location, leaving the old content without a reference you can use to overwrite it.

Unfortunately, few libraries and frameworks are designed to allow sensitive data to be overwritten. For example, destroying a key, as shown below, doesn't really remove the key from memory:

```java
SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec("key".getBytes(), "AES");
secretKey.destroy();
```

Overwriting the backing byte-array from `secretKey.getEncoded` doesn't remove the key either; the SecretKeySpec-based key returns a copy of the backing byte-array. See the sections below for the proper way to remove a `SecretKey` from memory.

The RSA key pair is based on the `BigInteger` type and therefore resides in memory after its first use outside the `AndroidKeyStore`. Some ciphers (such as the AES `Cipher` in `BouncyCastle`) do not properly clean up their byte-arrays.

User-provided data (credentials, social security numbers, credit card information, etc.) is another type of data that may be exposed in memory. Regardless of whether you flag it as a password field, `EditText` delivers content to the app via the `Editable` interface. If your app doesn't provide `Editable.Factory`, user-provided data will probably be exposed in memory for longer than necessary. The default `Editable` implementation, the `SpannableStringBuilder`, causes the same issues as Java's `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` cause (discussed above).

In summary, when performing static analysis to identify sensitive data that is exposed in memory, you should:

- Try to identify application components and map where data is used.
- Make sure that sensitive data is handled by as few components as possible.
- Make sure that object references are properly removed once the object containing the sensitive data is no longer needed.
- Make sure that garbage collection is requested after references have been removed.
- Make sure that sensitive data gets overwritten as soon as it is no longer needed.
  - Don't represent such data with immutable data types (such as `String` and `BigInteger`).
  - Avoid non-primitive data types (such as `StringBuilder`).
  - Overwrite references before removing them, outside the `finalize` method.
  - Pay attention to third-party components (libraries and frameworks).
    Public APIs are good indicators. Determine whether the public API handles the sensitive data as described in this chapter.

**The following section describes pitfalls of data leakage in memory and best practices for avoiding them.**

Don't use immutable structures (e.g., `String` and `BigInteger`) to represent secrets. Nullifying these structures will be ineffective: the garbage collector may collect them, but they may remain on the heap after garbage collection. Nevertheless, you should ask for garbage collection after every critical operation (e.g., encryption, parsing server responses that contain sensitive information). When copies of the information have not been properly cleaned (as explained below), your request will help reduce the length of time for which these copies are available in memory.

To properly clean sensitive information from memory, store it in primitive data types, such as byte-arrays (`byte[]`) and char-arrays (`char[]`). As described in the "Static Analysis" section above, you should avoid storing the information in mutable non-primitive data types.

Make sure to overwrite the content of the critical object once the object is no longer needed. Overwriting the content with zeroes is one simple and very popular method:

```java
byte[] secret = null;
try{
    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        Arrays.fill(secret, (byte) 0);
    }
}
```

This doesn't, however, guarantee that the content will be overwritten at run time. To optimize the bytecode, the compiler will analyze and decide not to overwrite data because it will not be used afterwards (i.e., it is an unnecessary operation). Even if the code is in the compiled DEX, the optimization may occur during the just-in-time or ahead-of-time compilation in the VM.

There is no silver bullet for this problem because different solutions have different consequences. For example, you may perform additional calculations (e.g., XOR the data into a dummy buffer), but you'll have no way to know the extent of the compiler's optimization analysis. On the other hand, using the overwritten data outside the compiler's scope (e.g., serializing it in a temp file) guarantees that it will be overwritten but obviously impacts performance and maintenance.

Then, using `Arrays.fill` to overwrite the data is a bad idea because the method is an obvious hooking target (see the chapter "Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android" for more details).

The final issue with the above example is that the content was overwritten with zeroes only. You should try to overwrite critical objects with random data or content from non-critical objects. This will make it really difficult to construct scanners that can identify sensitive data on the basis of its management.

Below is an improved version of the previous example:

```java
byte[] nonSecret = somePublicString.getBytes("ISO-8859-1");
byte[] secret = null;
try{
    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length; i++) {
            secret[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];
        }

        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/dev/null");
        out.write(secret);
        out.flush();
        out.close();
    }

For more information, take a look at [Securely Storing Sensitive Data in RAM](https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/secure-mobile-development/coding-practices/securely-store-sensitive-data-in-ram/ "Securely store sensitive data in RAM").

In the "Static Analysis" section, we mentioned the proper way to handle cryptographic keys when you are using `AndroidKeyStore` or `SecretKey`.

For a better implementation of `SecretKey`, look at the `SecureSecretKey` class below. Although the implementation is probably missing some boilerplate code that would make the class compatible with `SecretKey`, it addresses the main security concerns:

- No cross-context handling of sensitive data. Each copy of the key can be cleared from within the scope in which it was created.
- The local copy is cleared according to the recommendations given above.

  ```java
  public class SecureSecretKey implements javax.crypto.SecretKey, Destroyable {
      private byte[] key;
      private final String algorithm;

      /** Constructs SecureSecretKey instance out of a copy of the provided key bytes.
        * The caller is responsible of clearing the key array provided as input.
        * The internal copy of the key can be cleared by calling the destroy() method.
        */
      public SecureSecretKey(final byte[] key, final String algorithm) {
          this.key = key.clone();
          this.algorithm = algorithm;
      }

      public String getAlgorithm() {
          return this.algorithm;
      }

      public String getFormat() {
          return "RAW";
      }

      /** Returns a copy of the key.
        * Make sure to clear the returned byte array when no longer needed.
        */
      public byte[] getEncoded() {
          if(null == key){
              throw new NullPointerException();
          }

          return key.clone();
      }

      /** Overwrites the key with dummy data to ensure this copy is no longer present in memory.*/
      public void destroy() {
          if (isDestroyed()) {
              return;
          }

          byte[] nonSecret = new String("RuntimeException").getBytes("ISO-8859-1");
          for (int i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
            key[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];
          }

          FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/dev/null");
          out.write(key);
          out.flush();
          out.close();

          this.key = null;
          System.gc();
      }

      public boolean isDestroyed() {
          return key == null;
      }
  }
  ```

Secure user-provided data is the final secure information type usually found in memory. This is often managed by implementing a custom input method, for which you should follow the recommendations given here. However, Android allows information to be partially erased from `EditText` buffers via a custom `Editable.Factory`.

```java
EditText editText = ...; //  point your variable to your EditText instance
EditText.setEditableFactory(new Editable.Factory() {
  public Editable newEditable(CharSequence source) {
  ... // return a new instance of a secure implementation of Editable.
  }
});
```

Refer to the `SecureSecretKey` example above for an example `Editable` implementation. Note that you will be able to securely handle all copies made by `editText.getText` if you provide your factory. You can also try to overwrite the internal `EditText` buffer by calling `editText.setText`, but there is no guarantee that the buffer will not have been copied already. If you choose to rely on the default input method and `EditText`, you will have no control over the keyboard or other components that are used. Therefore, you should use this approach for semi-confidential information only.

#### Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis will help you identify potential problems, but it can't provide statistics about how long data has been exposed in memory, nor can it help you identify problems in closed-source dependencies. This is where dynamic analysis comes into play.

There are basically two ways to analyze the memory of a process: live analysis via a debugger and analyzing one or more memory dumps. Because the former is more of a general debugging approach, we will concentrate on the latter.

For rudimentary analysis, you can use Android Studio's built-in tools. They are on the _Android Monitor_ tab. To dump memory, select the device and app you want to analyze and click _Dump Java Heap_. This will create a _.hprof_ file in the _captures_ directory, which is on the app's project path.

![Create Heap Dump](Images/Chapters/0x05d/Dump_Java_Heap.png)

To navigate through class instances that were saved in the memory dump, select the Package Tree View in the tab showing the _.hprof_ file.

![Create Heap Dump](Images/Chapters/0x05d/Package_Tree_View.png)

For more advanced analysis of the memory dump, use the Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT). It is available as an Eclipse plugin and as a standalone application.

To analyze the dump in MAT, use the _hprof-conv_ platform tool, which comes with the Android SDK.

```shell
$ ./hprof-conv memory.hprof memory-mat.hprof
```

MAT provides several tools for analyzing the memory dump. For example, the _Histogram_ provides an estimate of the number of objects that have been captured from a given type, and the _Thread Overview_ shows processes' threads and stack frames. The _Dominator Tree_ provides information about keep-alive dependencies between objects. You can use regular expressions to filter the results these tools provide.

_Object Query Language_ studio is a MAT feature that allows you to query objects from the memory dump with an SQL-like language. The tool allows you to transform simple objects by invoking Java methods on them, and it provides an API for building sophisticated tools on top of the MAT.

```sql
SELECT * FROM java.lang.String
```

In the example above, all `String` objects present in the memory dump will be selected. The results will include the object's class, memory address, value, and retain count. To filter this information and see only the value of each string, use the following code:

```sql
SELECT toString(object) FROM java.lang.String object
```

Or

```sql
SELECT object.toString() FROM java.lang.String object
```

SQL supports primitive data types as well, so you can do something like the following to access the content of all `char` arrays:

```sql
SELECT toString(arr) FROM char[] arr
```

Don't be surprised if you get results that are similar to the previous results; after all, `String` and other Java data types are just wrappers around primitive data types. Now let's filter the results. The following sample code will select all byte arrays that contain the ASN.1 OID of an RSA key. This doesn't imply that a given byte array actually contains an RSA (the same byte sequence may be part of something else), but this is probable.

```sql
SELECT * FROM byte[] b WHERE toString(b).matches(".*1\.2\.840\.113549\.1\.1\.1.*")
```

Finally, you don't have to select whole objects. Consider an SQL analogy: classes are tables, objects are rows, and fields are columns. If you want to find all objects that have a "password" field, you can do something like the following:

```sql
SELECT password FROM ".*" WHERE (null != password)
```

During your analysis, search for:

- Indicative field names: "password", "pass", "pin", "secret", "private", etc.
- Indicative patterns (e.g., RSA footprints) in strings, char arrays, byte arrays, etc.
- Known secrets (e.g., a credit card number that you've entered or an authentication token provided by the backend)
- etc.

Repeating tests and memory dumps will help you obtain statistics about the length of data exposure. Furthermore, observing the way a particular memory segment (e.g., a byte array) changes may lead you to some otherwise unrecognizable sensitive data (more on this in the "Remediation" section below).

### Testing the Device-Access-Security Policy (MSTG-STORAGE-11)

#### Overview

Apps that process or query sensitive information should run in a trusted and secure environment. To create this environment, the app can check the device for the following:

- PIN- or password-protected device locking
- Recent Android OS version
- USB Debugging activation
- Device encryption
- Device rooting (see also "Testing Root Detection")

#### Static Analysis

To test the device-access-security policy that the app enforces, a written copy of the policy must be provided. The policy should define available checks and their enforcement. For example, one check could require that the app run only on Android Marshmallow (Android 6.0) or a more recent version, closing the app or displaying a warning if the Android version is less than 6.0.

Check the source code for functions that implement the policy and determine whether it can be bypassed.

You can implement checks on the Android device by querying  [_Settings.Secure_](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html "Settings.Secure") for system preferences. [_Device Administration API_](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html "Device Administration API") offers techniques for creating applications that can enforce password policies and device encryption.

#### Dynamic Analysis

The dynamic analysis depends on the checks enforced by the app and their expected behavior. If the checks can be bypassed, they must be validated.

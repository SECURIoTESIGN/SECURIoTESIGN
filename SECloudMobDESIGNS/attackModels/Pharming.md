# Pharming Attacks

Voice pharming aims to trick the victims into giving out their confidential information (e.g., SSN, credit card number, PIN) to the adversary. Similar to voice phishing, voice pharming exploits people’s trust in voice communication.

** Definition **

In pharming attacks, attackers can redirect web traffic in a mobile device to a malicious or bogus website. By collecting the subscriber’s mobile device information, specific attacks may follow after pharming attacks. For example, when a user browses a web site in a smartphone, the HTTP header usually includes the smartphone’s operating system, browser information, and version number. With this information, an attacker may learn the security leaks of the smartphone and is then able to start specific attacks on the smartphone.

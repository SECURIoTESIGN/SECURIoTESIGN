# The IoT-HarPSecA Tool

This is version 1.1 of the IoT-HarPSecA Tool, a tool that provides an interface that allows users to use the IoT-HarPSecA framework. The purpose of this framework is threefold. Firstly, it can help non-security experts to design secure IoT devices and applications by providing them with the necessary security requirements needed to develop secure IoT systems. Secondly, it can help non-security experts to generate security best practice guidelines for secure IoT development. Thirdly, the tool is intended to help users with little or no security expertise to implement security in their IoT devices and applications by recommending to them the most appropriate lightweight cryptographic algorithms for their software and hardware implementations.

IoT-HarPSecA is developed by Musa G. Samaila and Pedro R. M. Inácio from the Instituto de Telecomunicaçoes, and Department of Computer Science, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.

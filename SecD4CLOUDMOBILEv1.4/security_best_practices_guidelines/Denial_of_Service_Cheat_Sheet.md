# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Denial of Service 

## Denial of Service (DoS)

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make a system unavailable, by consuming all of its resources so that legitimate requests canâ€™t be served. The main goals of DoS attacks are to render systems unusable or significantly slow them down. 

### Best Practices

1. **Secure Your Firewall and Perimeter Devices:** Ensure that your firewall rules and configurations are updated and actively managed. Monitor and audit these components regularly for any changes or weaknesses that could be exploited.

2. **Implement an Intrusion Detection and/or Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Detect and respond to malicious traffic, as early as possible. This can be done with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and/or an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).

3. **Monitor Network Activity and Logs:** Track the source and duration of all incoming and outgoing traffic. Create rules that will alert you immediately when you detect suspicious activity. This will allow you to take action quickly and prevent the attack from escalating.

4. **Establish Network Behavior Baselines:** Establish a baseline for normal network traffic patterns and be prepared to identify any sudden spikes or abnormal activity.

5. **Reduce Network Flows and Data:** Take steps to reduce the amount of data flowing across your network. This can be done by limiting what services are accessible, or by setting up traffic filtering and prioritization rules.

6. **Deploy Resources Appropriately:** Make sure that load balancers, firewalls, and other networking devices are deployed in such a way that is capable of handling large amounts of traffic.

7. **Periodically Sandbox:** Periodically subject parts of the network to simulated DoS attacks. Use the results to identify weak spots and areas of improvement. This can be done using packet analyzers or DoS vulnerability assessment tools.

8. **Be Prepared to Respond:** Create a plan for responding to a DoS attack, anticipate different attack scenarios, and know how to identify any potential indicators of an attack in progress. 

9. **Educate Your Staff:** Make sure that your staff is aware of the risks associated with DoS attacks and how to recognize suspicious activity. Train them periodically to ensure they are up-to-date on the

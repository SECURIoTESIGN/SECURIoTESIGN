# Security Best Practices Guidelines for IoT System 

# Security Best Practices for IoT System Development 

As the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) systems continues to grow, so too does the need to ensure their security. While advice on security can be overwhelming and seem contradictory, there are certain measures that should be taken to ensure the safety of an IoT system and its connected users. This guide provides a set of best practices to consider for IoT system development. 

## Authentication

- Authentication should be used to verify an identity and the associated privileges of the user.
- All authentication should require strong passwords.
- Two-factor authentication should be used where possible.
- Provide a way for users to reset their passwords securely in case of lost or stolen credentials. 

## Access Control

- Access control should restrict who or what can access different parts of an IoT system. 
- Define access levels for different types of users and resources.
- Ensure that users have only the access they need to perform their tasks.

## Data Security

- Access to sensitive data should be limited and monitored.
- Sensitive data should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- IoT systems should store security and access logs.
- Regular security scans should be performed on the IoT system for known vulnerabilities.

## Device Security

- Ensure that all devices used by the IoT system are authenticated.
- Set a policy for patching and updating devices with security patches. 
- Securing network configuration protocols, such as the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). 
- Enable logging of activities on each device, alerting and reporting suspicious activities.

## Network Security

- Configure access control rules on the network level.
- Ensure that all network communications with the IoT system are encrypted using strong protocols. 
- Monitor the network for unauthorized access attempts and malicious traffic.

By following these security best practices, organizations can ensure that their IoT systems are secure and that the data and devices they use are safe.

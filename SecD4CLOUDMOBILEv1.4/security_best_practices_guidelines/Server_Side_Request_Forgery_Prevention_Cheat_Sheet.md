# Security Best Practices Guidelines for SSRF Prevention 

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack that forces a server to perform requests on behalf of an attacker. It can be used to compromise data, bypass authentication, and gain access to internal systems. 

The following security best practices can help prevent SSRF and protect against related attacks:  

- Develop and deploy applications securely and ensure that any input from an untrusted source is sanitized and validated.
- Block access to all unnecessary services, especially those that can be used to send requests to other systems. This includes the likes of external APIs, databases, and filesystems.
- Set up an internal firewall to prevent external requests from entering the network.
- Implement strong authentication and access control restrictions to verify that only authorized users can access critical resources.
- Monitor and log all requests to internal and/or external services.
- Patch and maintain all servers, web applications, and operating systems regularly to keep them up to date.
- Educate and train all staff to be aware of the risks associated with SSRF attacks.
- Make sure third-party APIs and services are configured securely and have adequate security measures in place.

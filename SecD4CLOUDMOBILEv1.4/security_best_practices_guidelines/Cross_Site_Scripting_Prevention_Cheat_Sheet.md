# Security Best Practices Guidelines for XSS 

## Security Best Practices for XSS 

1. **Enforce Input Validation** – All input data received from users must be validated BEFORE processing and stored. No unvalidated user-provided data should ever be trusted.

2. **Sanitize Input Data** – Sanitize all input data by removing special characters and HTML tags that can be used to launch XSS attacks.

3. **Escape Output Data** – Make sure all output data is properly escaped. HTML entities should be used to escape data displayed on web pages.

4. **Strict Content Security Policies** – Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to ensure browsers only execute scripts and stylesheets that are explicitly allowed.

5. **No Mixed Content** – Avoid using both `http` and `https` resources in the same web page to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

6. **Limit User Access** – Provide users with only the necessary permissions to access the parts of your application that they need.

7. **Regularly Monitor Log Files** – Monitor log files for suspicious activity, such as suspicious and unexpected file uploads and downloads.

8. **Regularly Perform Audits** – Regularly check the code for any vulnerabilities that could result from XSS emails.

9. **Disable MIME Type Sniffing** – Make sure to disable MIME type sniffing in your web application to prevent attackers from uploading malicious files with unexpected MIME types.

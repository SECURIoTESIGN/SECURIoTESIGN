# Testing the Pharming Attack 

Testing a pharming attack requires several steps:

1. Use a vulnerability scanner to identify and assess the security of the computer systems, networks, and applications.
2. Access the system and perform a detailed analysis of the system logs and audit trails.
3. Perform a packet sniffing test to detect any malicious activity.
4. Check for any Domain Name System (DNS) anomalies and any suspicious domain redirection. 
5. Check if the DNS cache poisoning technique has been employed.
6. Use a URL analyzer tool to detect any malicious redirects or domain name changes.
7. Run a malware scan on the system to detect any malicious code or program.
8. Use a honeypot system to detect any suspicious activity on the network.

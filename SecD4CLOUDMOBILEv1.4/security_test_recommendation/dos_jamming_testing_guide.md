# Testing the DoS or Cellular Jamming Attack 

### Testing a DoS or Cellular Jamming Attack

1. **Establish the Test Environment:** Ensure the network under test, the device under attack, and the attacker device are all properly isolated and configured. 

2. **Run the DoS or Jamming Attack** Use methods such as flooding and injection attacks to simulate a DoS or jamming attack.

3. **Monitor Traffic:** Monitor the traffic to ensure it is being disrupted.

4. **Verify Results:** Analyze the results to confirm the attack was successful and measure its effectiveness.

5. **Validate the Attack:** Make sure that only the desired target is being affected by the attack and that the attack did not have any unintended side-effects.

6. **Analyze Results:** Gather more information to better understand the results. Look for patterns or behaviors that could be useful in preventing similar attacks in the future.

# Testing the Bypassing Physical Security Attack 

## Testing Physical Security Bypass Techniques

Physical security bypass is a type of attack where a malicious user attempts to access assets, data, or resources by circumventing physical access controls. Bypassing physical security measures can be done in several ways, and it is important to test for these attacks in order to protect your organization. Here are a few key techniques for testing physical security bypasses: 

1. Perform a security walkthrough of the physical premises: This includes inspecting the external and internal perimeter for any potential weaknesses or exposures. Look for any open windows, inadequate locks, unlocked or malfunctioning doors, and other security lapses. 

2. Test for duplicate keys or key overrides: This includes testing if keys are kept in secure locations, if duplicate keys are being issued, and if any employees have illegally duplicated their keys.

3. Check for any unauthorized devices in the area: This includes testing for cameras, microphones, recording devices, and other electronic surveillance equipment that may have been planted inside of the building. 

4. Ensure that all exterior doors and windows are locked: Check to make sure all exterior doors and windows cannot be easily picked or bypassed.

5. Test for wireless network vulnerabilities: Wireless networks can be easily used to bypass physical security measures, so test for any wireless security weaknesses that may be present. 

By testing for these vulnerabilities, you can ensure that your organization is not vulnerable to physical security bypass attacks.

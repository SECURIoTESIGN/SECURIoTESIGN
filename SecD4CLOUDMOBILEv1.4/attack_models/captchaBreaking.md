 * Conducting DoS and DDoS attacks;
 * Excessive exploitation of network resources by bots.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the CAPTCHA Breaking attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security tests present in the full report are followed.

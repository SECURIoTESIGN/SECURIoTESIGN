# Wi-Fi SSID Tracking Attacks

Unlike code injection, in this type of attack, an attacker exploits a weakness in the target in order to force arbitrary code to be retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed.

## Definition

This type of attack aims to obtain sensitive data (location, routine, trajectory, etc.) of users of mobile devices using Wi-Fi networks to access the Internet. Furthermore, it consists of using sophisticated sniffing devices to bypass authentication (for closed networks), extract and identify the MAC address of the mobile device and establish a match with its potential owner.
 
## Technical Impact

 * Read Data;
 * Bypass Protection Mechanism.

## Typical Severity

 * Low.

## Risk Analysis

 * Very High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

 * Medium.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Wi-Fi SSID Tracking attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

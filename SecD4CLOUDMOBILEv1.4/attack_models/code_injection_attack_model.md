# Code Injection Attacks

This type of attack targets injecting malicious code into user inputs from the interface (web application forms or hybrid mobile applications) of applications written in HTML5.


## Definition

These types of applications are vulnerable to code injection attacks because of the possibility of merging the application's data and implementation code. In case of hybrid mobile applications based on HTLM5, it has increased the attack vectors or channels such as, Contacts, SMS, Wi-Fi, NFC, QR Code, etc. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code to exhaust all the victim's resources. A clear example of such an attack is XSS, already described in Subsection. 

 * Embedding Scripts within Scripts;
 * File Content Injection;
 * Using Meta-characters in E-mail Headers to Inject Malicious Payloads;
 * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS);
 * Cross-Browser Cross-Domain Theft.

### Mitigation
Mitigation strategies for Code Injection vulnerabilities typically include input validation, use of parameterized queries, and least privilege principle.

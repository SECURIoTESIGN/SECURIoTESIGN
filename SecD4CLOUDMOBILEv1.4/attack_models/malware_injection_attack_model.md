# Malware Injection & Malware-as-a-Service Attack Models

---

## Malware Injection

### Definition

**Malware injection** is the act of inserting malicious code, binaries, firmware, or scripts into legitimate software, device firmware, container images, OTA updates, package repositories or runtime processes so that the malware is delivered to target systems under the guise of normal artifacts. In cloud and IoT contexts this includes poisoned container images, compromised firmware updates, malicious SDKs/dependencies, or process-level code injection that executes in trusted contexts.

---

### Attack Categories

* **Software supply-chain compromise:** injecting malware into libraries, package repositories, CI/CD pipelines, or signed releases.
* **Compromised firmware / OTA poisoning:** malicious firmware or backdoored boot images shipped to or pushed to devices.
* **Container / image tampering:** embedding malware into Docker/OCI images or injecting malicious init scripts.
* **Dependency poisoning:** publishing malicious versions of popular packages that are pulled by build systems.
* **Runtime/process injection:** DLL/so injection, script injection or exploitation of deserialization that results in code execution inside trusted processes.
* **Insider-assisted injection:** privileged actors placing malicious artifacts in build or provisioning systems.

---

### Mitigations

* **Secure software supply chain:** sign artifacts (images, packages, firmware) and verify signatures end-to-end; use SBOMs and provenance records.
* **Harden CI/CD:** immutable build agents, least-privilege credentials, secure secret storage, code-signing keys in HSMs and multi-party approvals for releases.
* **Image & package scanning:** automated SCA, malware/IOC scanning, and runtime image verification in orchestration (image policy admission).
* **Firmware integrity:** secure boot, anti-rollback, signed OTA and staged rollouts with canaries.
* **Runtime protections:** EDR/XDR, process integrity checks, container runtime security, and least privilege for service accounts.
* **Monitoring & anomaly detection:** baseline behaviour, telemetry for unexpected outbound connections, unusual process creation, and automated quarantine playbooks.

### DREAD assessment (Malware Injection)

| Factor           | Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Damage Potential |     9 | Malware delivered via trusted artifacts can cause wide, persistent compromise across cloud tenants and device fleets.                          |
| Reproducibility  |     7 | Supply-chain/CI compromises require some access but techniques are established; dependency poisoning is trivial at scale for popular packages. |
| Exploitability   |     7 | Varies from low (typosquatting dependencies) to high effort (compromised signing keys); many deployments remain vulnerable.                    |
| Affected Users   |     9 | A poisoned artifact can reach many users/devices at scale.                                                                                     |
| Discoverability  |     6 | Malicious code in trusted artifacts can be stealthy; detection requires strong telemetry and scanning.                                         |

**Digit-by-digit arithmetic:**
Sum = 9 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 6 = 38.
Average = 38 / 5 = 7.6.

**DREAD average = 7.6**; Rating: **High / Critical**.

## Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)

### Definition

**Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)** refers to criminal ecosystems that commoditise malware: developers create malware (ransomware, botnets, cryptominers, loaders) and sell or lease it to affiliates or customers, often providing user-friendly control panels, support, payment/affiliate systems, and infrastructure (C2, bulletproof hosting). MaaS lowers the barrier to entry and enables wide-scale attacks against cloud and IoT targets.

---

### Attack Categories

* **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):** affiliates deploy ransomware and share profits with operators.
* **Botnet-for-hire / DDoS-for-hire:** renting botnets to launch volumetric attacks or to install further malware.
* **Access-as-a-Service / Initial Access Brokers (IABs):** selling access to compromised cloud tenants or IoT networks.
* **Loader / Dropper families:** modular malware sold to deliver plugins (info-stealers, miners, cryptominers).
* **Affiliate ecosystems & support services:** payment handling, crypters, C2 panels, and fraud infrastructure offered as service.

---

### Mitigations

* **Threat intelligence & blocking:** subscribe to TI feeds to block known payload hashes, C2 domains, and indicators across networks and endpoints.
* **Harden endpoints & cloud workloads:** EDR/XDR, runtime app self-protection, micro-segmentation and secure IaaS/CSP configurations to prevent lateral movement.
* **Credential & privilege hygiene:** MFA, ephemeral credentials, least privilege and strong IAM controls to reduce opportunities for MaaS operators and affiliates.
* **Supply-chain & app-store vigilance:** monitor marketplaces and repos for threats; implement app vetting and repository hardening.
* **Rapid incident response & backups:** tested IR plans, immutable backups, and isolate infected workloads to limit damage from ransomware.
* **Legal & takedown coordination:** report MaaS infrastructure to CERTs/LEA and coordinate with providers for takedown where possible.

### DREAD Assessment

| Factor           | Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Damage Potential |     8 | MaaS enables destructive campaigns (ransomware, botnets) but operator intent and scale vary; cloud billing/rent costs can also be exploited. |
| Reproducibility  |     9 | Low barrier to entry; MaaS platforms, crypters and tutorials make attacks easy to reproduce.                                                 |
| Exploitability   |     8 | Many MaaS campaigns leverage phishing, exposed credentials, or unpatched services—commonly exploitable vectors.                              |
| Affected Users   |     8 | Cloud tenants, managed IoT fleets and supply chains can be heavily impacted.                                                                 |
| Discoverability  |     8 | MaaS tooling and C2s are observable via TI, but some operators use fast-flux and obfuscation to hide activity.                               |

**Digit-by-digit arithmetic:**
Sum = 8 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 41.
Average = 41 / 5 = 8.2.

**DREAD average = 8.2** ; Rating: **Very High / Critical**

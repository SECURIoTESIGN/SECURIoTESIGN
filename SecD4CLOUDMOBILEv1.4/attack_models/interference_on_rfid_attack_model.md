# RF Interference on RFIDs

## Overview 

RF Interference on RFIDs attack is a type of attack that disrupts the communication between RFID tags and readers by generating unwanted signals in the same frequency band. This can cause performance degradation, misinterpretation, or loss of information for the RFID system. RF interference can be caused by natural or manmade sources, such as lightning, solar flares, power lines, microwave ovens, or other wireless devices. It can also be caused by intentional jamming operations that aim to prevent or sabotage the RFID system.

RF interference attacks aim to disrupt or block the communication between the RFID reader and the RFID tag, thereby preventing the successful reading or writing of data. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the RFID system's communication protocols and can have various motivations, including unauthorized access, data theft, or sabotage.

## Mitigation

1. **Frequency Hopping:** Implement frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) in your RFID systems. This technique changes the frequency of the signal at regular intervals, making it harder for an attacker to interfere with the signal;
2. **Signal Shielding:* Use signal shielding techniques to protect your RFID systems from unwanted RF signals. This can be achieved by using materials that block RF signals, such as metal or special types of paint;
3. **Error Correction Codes:** Implement error correction codes in your RFID systems. These codes can detect and correct errors in the data transmitted over the RF signal, reducing the impact of interference;
4. **Power Level Adjustments:** Adjust the power level of the RFID reader to minimize the impact of interference. This can be done dynamically based on the level of interference detected;
5. **Use of Anti-Collision Protocols:** Implement anti-collision protocols to prevent interference between multiple RFID tags that are in the range of the same reader;
6. **Regular Monitoring and Auditing:** Regularly monitor the performance of your RFID systems and conduct audits to identify and address any potential interference issues.

**Overall, RF interference on RFIDs can pose a high to critical risk depending on the security measures in place.

# Wi-Fi Jamming Attacks

In a scenario of this type of attack, the attacker targets the wireless network made available from the access point, with the aim of making it unavailable.

## Definition

 This is a denial-of-service attack that blocks the radio frequency, making access to the Wi-Fi network and consequently to the Internet unavailable. Generally, two techniques are used to carry out this type of attack, namely: 1) The attacker may flood the Wi-Fi access point (e.g. the retransmission device) with deauthentication frames; 2) Another method is to transmit high levels of noise on the RF band used by the Wi-Fi network.

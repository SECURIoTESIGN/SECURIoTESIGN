# SQL Injection Attacks

In this type of attack, an attacker could provide malicious input with a clever mix of characters and meta characters from a form (e.g., login form) to alter the logic of the SQL command.


## Definition

Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack is a code injection technique commonly used to attack web applications where an attacker enters SQL characters or keywords into an SQL statement through superuser input parameters for the purpose to change the logic of the desired query.

## Mitigation

1. **Input Validation**: Validate input data thoroughly. Use a whitelist of accepted characters, and reject any input that contains characters not on the list;

2. **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that input data is treated as literal values and not executable code;

3. **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit the privileges of database accounts used by web applications. Don't use the database root account, and don't grant more privileges than necessary to a user account;

4. **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all software, including operating systems, databases, and applications, up to date. This helps to patch any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers;

5. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use firewalls and IDS to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules;

6. **User Education**: Educate users about the risks of SQL Injection attacks and how to recognize them. This includes not providing sensitive information to untrusted sources;

7. **Secure Cloud Configurations**: Ensure that your cloud configurations are secure and that all data is encrypted during transmission;

8. **IoT Security Measures**: Implement IoT-specific security measures such as device authentication, secure booting, and hardware-based security solutions.

Remember, security is a continuous process and it's important to stay updated with the latest threats and mitigation strategies.

Notes:

* The base score is 9.0 (Critical) due to the potential for high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.
* The "Scope" (S) is "Data Breach" as attackers can steal sensitive data from the database.
* The Environmental Score is crucial. Implementing input validation and sanitization in the mobile app to ensure clean data reaches the server, using stored procedures in the cloud database to minimize user input in queries, and deploying intrusion detection/prevention systems to identify and block malicious attempts can significantly mitigate the risk.

**Overall, SQL injection vulnerabilities pose a high to critical risk in a mobile cloud-based application. Secure coding practices, input validation, and layered security throughout the mobile app and cloud environment are essential to reduce the risk of data breaches, data manipulation, and database disruptions.**

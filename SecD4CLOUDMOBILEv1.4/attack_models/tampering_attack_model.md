# Tampering Attack 

A tampering attack is a type of malicious attack whereby an attacker attempts to alter or modify data that is transmitted between two nodes. It is a type of attack in which the attacker attempts to modify or corrupt data in order to cause harm or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Tampering attacks can target all types of web applications, including web APIs and databases.

Tampering attacks can include activities such as: 

- Injecting malicious code into a web page or API response
- Modifying network traffic by altering or deleting packets
- Intercepting and manipulating requests and responses
- Corrupting data stored in memory or on disk
- Altering parameters or headers in requests
- Injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML into an application
- Manipulating browsersâ€™ cookies or local storage
- Exploiting weaknesses in authorization and authentication protocols

## Mitigation

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit. This can prevent an attacker from understanding or modifying the data even if they manage to access it;

2. **Integrity Checks**: Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of data and software. This can help detect any unauthorized modifications;

3. **Access Controls**: Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized access to data and systems. This includes using strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and least privilege principles;

4. **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all software, including operating systems and applications, up to date. This helps to patch any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers;

5. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use firewalls and IDS to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules;

6. **Physical Security**: Implement physical security measures to prevent tampering with hardware devices. This is especially important for IoT devices;

7. **Secure Cloud Configurations**: Ensure that your cloud configurations are secure and that all data is encrypted during transmission;

8. **IoT Security Measures**: Implement IoT-specific security measures such as device authentication, secure booting, and hardware-based security solutions.

Remember, security is a continuous process and it's important to stay updated with the latest threats and mitigation strategies.

Notes:

* The base score is 9.0 (Critical) due to the potential for high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.
* The "Scope" (S) is "Data Loss" as tampered data can be effectively lost and unusable.
* The Environmental Score is crucial. Implementing data integrity checks throughout the ecosystem (mobile app, cloud storage, and potentially within IoT devices), code signing for mobile apps and cloud components, secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data, and intrusion detection systems to identify tampering attempts can significantly mitigate the risk.

**Overall, tampering vulnerabilities pose a high to critical risk in a mobile-cloud-IoT ecosystem. A comprehensive security approach with data integrity checks, code signing, secure storage, and intrusion detection across all components is essential to reduce the risk of data breaches, compromised functionality, and system disruptions.**

# Sniffing

This type of attack is carried out by attackers who use applications that can capture data packets in transit over a network, and if they are not heavily encrypted, can be read or interpreted. The goal of the attacker is to spy on all kinds of conversations and recordings and to listen to communication channels.

## Definition

This type of attack consists of implant eavesdropping tools in specific network for spying on communication channels, capturing the network traffic behavior and getting the network map. Eavesdropping is dangerous threat that leads to break down the integrity and confidentiality which causes financial and personal failures. There are several ways to get a sniffing attack on a smartphone, as there is a vulnerability in GSM's encryption function for call and SMS privacy, A5 / 1 (it can be stopped second). This vulnerability puts all GSM subscribers at risk of sniffing attacks.

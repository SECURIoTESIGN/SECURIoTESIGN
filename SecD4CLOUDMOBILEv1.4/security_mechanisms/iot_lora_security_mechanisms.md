# IoT and LoRa Security Mechanisms

The IoT ecosystem offers a flexible approach to organizing smart applications and constructing consumer-oriented infrastructure. However, several issues affect the security and privacy of the parties involved, particularly concerning low-power IoT devices. Often, there is a trade-off between implementing cybersecurity measures and maintaining operational efficiency within established tolerances. Consequently, the implementation of data protection and cyber defense mechanisms tends to be prioritized last.

Below is a summary of the security mechanisms to be implemented for the IoT and LoRa/NB-IoT ecosystem.

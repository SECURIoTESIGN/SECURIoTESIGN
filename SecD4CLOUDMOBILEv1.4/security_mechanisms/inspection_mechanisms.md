# Inspection Mechanisms 

An inspection mechanism is a process or tool used to ensure that cloud-based mobile apps meet certain quality and security requirements. Inspection mechanisms involve thoroughly evaluating the source code, architecture, and security of the app to ensure it meets the desired standard. Examples of inspection mechanisms include static code analysis, application security testing, architectural design reviews, and penetration testing. These inspection mechanisms help identify any weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or security issues in the app before it is deployed in the cloud.

## Inspection Mechanisms Examples:

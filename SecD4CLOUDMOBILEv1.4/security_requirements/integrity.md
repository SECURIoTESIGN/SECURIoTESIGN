# Integrity 

**Integrity** is one of the key security requirements that must be addressed in security engineering. This requirement is used to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data and systems.

The integrity requirement helps to protect against malicious attacks, such as data tampering, data manipulation, or unauthorized access. It also helps to ensure that data is kept secure and stored in its original form.

Other aspects of integrity in security engineering include:

- Data authentication: Data authentication is a process of verifying the accuracy of data by validating digital signatures, checksums, encryption, and other techniques.

- Access control: Access control measures help to ensure that only authorized users have access to data and systems.

- Backup and recovery: Backup and recovery processes help to maintain data integrity in case of system failure or malicious attacks.

- Logging and auditing: Logging and auditing are processes to track user activity and ensure data integrity.

## Warning: 

**If we fail to guarantee integrity requirements, the system may be compromised in a variety of ways. Some possible outcomes include:**

- Data can be corrupted or modified without the knowledge of the user
- Hackers can break into the system and steal sensitive information
- Malicious software can be installed in the system
- Unauthorized users may be granted access to the system
- System performance can suffer due to malicious attacks or malicious code
- Security of the system can be compromised

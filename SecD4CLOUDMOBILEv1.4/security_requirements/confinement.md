# Confinement 

**Confinement requirement in security engineering**

Confinement requirements in security engineering are security requirements that ensure that privileged operations and activities (both internal and external) are constrained so that they cannot be abused or manipulated for malicious purposes. These requirements are generally implemented using a combination of hardware, software, processes, policies, and other safeguards. By confining privileged operations and activities within a secure boundary and ensuring that only authorized and authenticated parties can access these operations and activities, confidential information and systems remain safe and secure.

## Warning: 

When confinement requirements are not met, the system can be vulnerable to security vulnerabilities and breaches. Without proper boundaries, malicious actors can have unrestricted access to the system, allowing them to tamper with data, modify settings, or take complete control over the system. This could lead to malicious activities such as unauthorized data exfiltration, espionage, and sabotage. Furthermore, if the system is not properly secured, then attackers can use this access to launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, spread malware, or install malicious software.

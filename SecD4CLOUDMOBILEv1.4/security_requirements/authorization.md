# Authorization 

**Authorization** requirements are security measures that ensure only authorized personnel can access a system or database. These requirements are designed to protect systems and data from malicious activity or unauthorized access. Authorization requirements include authentication mechanisms, role-based access control, and audit logging.

Authentication mechanisms are designed to ensure that users or processes are who they say they are. Authentication can be done by combining something a user knows (e.g. a password) with something they have (e.g. a token) or something they are (e.g. a biometric fingerprint scan). 

Role-based access control (RBAC) enables officials to assign user roles that limit access to certain functions and data. RBAC can be used to prevent access of sensitive information to prevent data leaks or damage to the system.

Audit logging is a process of tracking and recording changes in system activities and records. Auditing logs can be used for troubleshooting.

## Warning: 

**If we fail to guarantee authorization requirements, it can lead to a number of consequences for the system:**

- Unauthorized users may have access to confidential information or make changes to the system without permission.
- Data stored in the system may be manipulated or corrupted by unauthorized users.
- System performance could be significantly impacted due to malicious activity.
- System security may be compromised, resulting in a breach of sensitive information.
- Legitimate users may be denied access to the system due to incorrect permissions.

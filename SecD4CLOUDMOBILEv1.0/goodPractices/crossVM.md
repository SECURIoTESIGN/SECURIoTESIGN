# Cross VM Attacks (Side channel attacks)

Side-channel attacks are used to extract cryptographic keys from a victim device or process in a virtualized layer of the cloud ecosystem where a Cross-VM attack exploits the nature of multi-tenancy, which enables that VMs belonging to different customers may co-reside on the same physical machine.


## Definition

Side-channel attack, which leverages low-bandwidth message channels (e.g., timing, power, cache misses) in a system to derive or leak security - sensitive information, has been proven to be realistic threats to modern computer systems. Among them, cache-based side-channel attacks have been shown practical to steal cryptographic information within a
single operating system. The main idea is that cryptographic algorithms usually have data-dependent memory access patterns, which can be revealed by observing and
analyzing the associated cache hit/miss statistics. Cache-based attacks then can rely on certain statistics during the encryption or decryption operations to extract the cryptographic key. Recent research has shown attackers can build up cross-VM side channels to obtain sensitive information. However, currently these channels are mostly based on shared CPU cache, networks, CPU loads and so on. These attacks are generally categorized into one of three classes:

 * Time-driven side-channel attack;
 * Trace-driven side-channel attacks;
 * Access-driven side-channel attacks.

# The Requirements to develop your tool are: 
---
---
## Confidentiality                           

The property that ensures that information is
not disclosed or made available to any

## Integrity                                 

Is the property of safeguarding the          
correctness and completeness of assets in an 
IoT system. In other words it involves       
maintaining the data consistent, trustworthy 
and accurate during its life-cycle           
---
## Availability                              

Refers to the property which ensures that an 
IoT device or system is accessible and usable
upon demand by authorized entities. In other 
words the device needs to be always available
to access by authorized people               
---
## Authentication                            

Is the assurance that information transaction
is from the source it claims to be from. The 
device authenticates itself prior to         
receiving or transmitting any information.   
It assures that the information received     
is authentic                                 
---
## Authorization                             

The property that determines whether the user
or device has rights/privileges to access a  
resource, or issue commands                  
---
## Non-Repudiation                           

The security property that ensures that the  
transfer of messages or credentials between 2
IoT entities is undeniable                   
---
## Accountability                            

The property that ensures that every action  
can be traced back to a single user or device
---
## Reliability                               

Refers to the property that guarantees       
consistent intended behavior of an a general 
system, in this case applied to IoT          
---
## Privacy                                   

In the context of IoT, privacy refers to the 
control of the user over the disclosure of   
his data. In other words only the user has   
control of the sharing of is personal        
information, is data is only made public if  
the user allowed it                          
---
## Physical Security                         

Refers to the security measures designed to  
deny unauthorized physical access to IoT     
devices and equipment, and to protect them   
from damage or in other words gaining        
physical access to the device won't give     
access to it's information                   
---
## Forgery Resistance                        

Is the propriety that ensures that the       
contents shared between entities cannot be   
forged by a third party trying to damage or  
harm the system or its users. In other words 
no one can try to forge content and send it  
in the name of another entities              
---
## Tamper Detection                          

Ensures all devices are physically secured,  
such that any tampering attempt is detected  
---
## Data Freshness                            

status that ensures that data is the most    
recent, and that old messages are not        
mistakenly used as fresh or purposely        
replayed by perpetrators. In other words this
requirement provides the guarantee that the  
data displayed is the most recent            
---
## Confinement                               

Ensures that even if a party is corrupted,

# Interoperability     
Is the propriety that ensures that different software communicates and works well with each-other. I.e a software in health-care that works with data that comes from a third-party needs to be able to use and process the information given to it by this software. 

## This requirement is applied in the entire system.  

ot addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:                                                             

## Impersonation Attack:                               
In this attack the attacker pretends to be one of the users of the system to fulfill is bad intentions.

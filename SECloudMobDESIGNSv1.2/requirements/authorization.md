# Authorization  

The property that determines whether the user or device has rights/privileges to access a resource, or issue commands.  

**Note:** *These requirements or assumptions apply to the secure coding of PHP, C/C++, Java, C#, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Swift programming languages in building mobile Android application and were the information might be accessed from and between the communications in the cloud and mobile ecosystem.*  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:                                                      

### 1. SQL Injection Attack

In  this  attack  the  perpetrator injects  malicious code in the system to gain access to information or even to gain control of the entire system. 

### 2. XSS Attack

In  this  attack  the  perpetrator injects  malicious code in the system to gain access to information or even to gain control of the entire system.

### 3. Reused IP Address

This type of attack occurs whenever a IP address is reused on a network. This occurs because in a network the number of IP addresses is usually limited, which causes an address assigned to one user to be assigned to another, so that it leaves the network.                         

### 4. Botnet Attacks
 
A botnet is a collection of compromised devices that can be remotely controlled by an attacker, i.e. the bot master. Its main purpose is to steal business information, remote access, online fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, etc.                                    

### 5. Sniffing Attacks

This type of attack is carried out by attackers using applications that can capture data packets in transit on a network, and if they are not heavily encrypted, can be read or interpreted. 
                            
### 6. Wrapping Attacks 
                                                         
In this attack scenario, the attacker duplicates the SOAP message in the course of the translation and sends it to the server as a legitimate user. Therefore, the attacker may interfere with the malicious code. 

### 7. Google Hacking Attacks

This type of attack involves the use of the Google search engine for the purpose of discovering confidential information that a hacker or wrongdoer can use for their benefit by hacking the account of a used.

### 8. Hypervisor Attacks 

Neste tipo de ataque o atacante tem como alvo comprometer a autenticidade dos dados sensíveis dos utilizadores e a disponibilidade de serviços a partir da cloud ao nível das VMs. 

### 9. OS Command Injection
 
Applications are considered vulnerable to the OS command injection attack if they utilize non validated user input in a system level command what can lead to the invocation of scripts injected by the attacker.

### 10. Buffer Overflows
                                                          
Buffer overflows is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory. It can be triggered by non-validated inputs that are designed to execute code.

### 11. Session Hijacking 
                                                         
An attacker impersonates a legitimate user through stealing or predicting a valid session ID. 
                                                           
### 12. Session Fixation 
                                      
An attacker has a valid session ID and forces the victim to use this ID.

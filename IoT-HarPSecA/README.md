# The IoT-HarPSecA Tool

This is version 1.0 of the IoT-HarPSecA Tool, a tool that provides an interface that allows users to use of the IoT-HarPSecA framework. The purpose of this framework is twofold. Firstly, it helps non-security experts to design secure IoT devices and applications by providing them with the necessary security requirements before they even create the device or application. Secondly, the tool is intended to help users that have little or no security expertise to select the appropriate lightweight cryptographic algorithms for their software or hardware implementations.

IoT-HarPSecA is developed by Musa G. Samaila and Pedro R. M. Inácio from the Instituto de Telecomunicaçoes, and Department of Computer Science, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.

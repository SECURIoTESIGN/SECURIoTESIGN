## SECURECloudMobilEQUIREMENTS

This program implements a questionnaire about the development of an application for 
the cloud and mobile ecosystem and generates a report with security requirements, aiming

security requirement. It is part of the outputs of project Systematization of the Safety Engineering Process in the Cloud and Mobile Ecosystem.

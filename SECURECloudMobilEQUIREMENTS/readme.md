## SECURECloudMobilEQUIREMENTS

This program implements a questionnaire about the development of an application for 
the cloud and mobile ecosystem and generates a report with security requirements, aiming 
at the safe development of applications. In addition, a taxonomy of potential attacks can be 
generated as a consequence of not incorporating security mechanisms that guarantee a certain 
security requirement. It is part of the outputs of project Project Systematization of Security 
Engineering Process in Cloud and Mobile Ecosystem.

 ** Installation ** 
   * Install Python 3x;
   * Run the application from IDLE, Visual Studio Code, PyCharme or another compatible IDE to the Python programming language.

# Data Freshness 

**Data Freshness** is a requirement in security engineering which is concerned with ensuring that data requires updating periodically and is not outdated. 

In order to ensure data freshness, organizations must have a defined and enforced policy regarding when and how often the data must be updated. Some organizations may require daily or even hourly updates, while others may adopt a more relaxed approach. 

Good data freshness practices also require that data must not be allowed to become stale or out-of-date, and should be regularly monitored to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.

## Warning: 

If the system fails to guarantee data freshness, there will be a number of consequences. These include:

* Unreliable data and results: Data which is not up to date can lead to unreliable insights and inaccurate business decisions.

* Missed opportunities and delayed decisions: Using stale data can lead to the loss of potential opportunities, as well as a delay in making decisions. 

* Lack of trust: By not maintaining fresh data, the system will lose credibility with its users and may be deemed untrustworthy. 

* Poor customer experience: Data that is not up to date can result in a poor customer experience, leading to dissatisfaction and a loss of customers.

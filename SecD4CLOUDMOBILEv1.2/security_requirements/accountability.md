# Accountability 

## Accountability Requirement in Security Engineering

Security engineering is the process of designing and building secure systems. A key feature of security engineering is the requirement for accountability. This means that when something goes wrong with a system, it must be possible to determine who was responsible for the incident and take appropriate action.

Accountability has several components including:

- **Auditable Events**: Events in the system should be logged and tracked to allow for audit and investigation.

- **Identification**: Access controls must be in place to identify and authenticate users who interact with the system. 

- **Authorization**: Users should only be given access to resources that they have been explicitly authorized to access.

- **Privileges and Access Control**: Access to system components must be managed and restricted to only users who have the necessary privileges and clearance.

- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data stored within the system must be protected from

## Warning: 

If we fail to guarantee accountability requirements, the system will become insecure and vulnerable. This could lead to data being exposed to unauthorized persons or malicious actors. It can also lead to data breaches, where confidential and sensitive information is leaked. This could result in financial or reputational damage to the organization. Furthermore, without accountability, it can be difficult to prove who is responsible for any wrongdoing or breaches of security.

# Non-repudiation 

Non-repudiation is a term used in information security that refers to a legal concept describing the assurance that someone cannot deny that they performed a certain action. It is a critical security requirement for many businesses, especially in the fields of finance and e-commerce. 

In security engineering, non-repudiation refers to the technical capability of preventing a source from denying having performed an action, such as sending a message or making a payment. To achieve non-repudiation, various cryptographic techniques can be used, such as digital signatures and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

## Non-repudiation requirement in security engineering

Non-repudiation is a critical security requirement in many organizations, as it helps ensure that the source of a transaction or message cannot be denied at a later point in time. To guarantee non-repudiation, security engineering must employ various cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures, Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), or other methods of

##### Consequences of Failing to Guarantee Non-Repudiation Requirements

If a system fails to guarantee non-repudiation requirements, it can lead to a variety of serious consequences in both the short and long term. Some of these consequences include:

- Loss of customer confidence and potential decrease in revenue due to lack of trust
- Increased risk of fraudulent activities and unauthorized transactions 
- Damage to brand reputation
- Legal issues and possible fines/penalties due to non-compliance with regulations
- Inability to prove ownership or responsibility for an action
- Difficulty in resolving disputes between parties

# Reliability 

**Reliability Requirement in Security Engineering**

* The system must be able to detect and record any unauthorized access attempts. 
* The system must provide an adequate level of fault tolerance.
* The system must be able to inform the users of any security breaches so action can be taken. 
* The system must be able to withstand natural disasters or other forms of attack. 
* The system must be able to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. 
* The system must be able to detect malicious code or errors that could cause potential data loss. 
* The system must be able to restore any data that is lost or corrupted in the event of an attack. 
* The system must be able to notify and inform appropriate personnel of any unauthorized access attempts and malicious activity. 
* The system must be able to protect itself from malicious attack and be resilient to any changes in the environment. 
* The system must be designed

## Warning: 

If reliability requirements are not met, the system may experience decreased performance, data loss, or downtime. This could result in a loss of user confidence in the system, decreased efficiency, and potentially loss of revenue. It could also result in customers going elsewhere for services and products, leading to a decline in profits and market share.

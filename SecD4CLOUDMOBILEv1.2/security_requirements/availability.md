# Availability 

## Availability Requirement in Security Engineering

Availability requirement in security engineering refers to the need for secure systems to remain operational and available to users when required. Achieving availability without sacrificing security is often a challenge, as attackers may attempt to disrupt system availability in order to deny service or gain access to sensitive information.

Security engineering must therefore consider and account for the availability of system components, including network connections, storage systems, and web applications. Examples of availability requirements include: 

* Ensuring that system services remain available despite distributed denial of service (DDoS) or other types of attacks.
* Preventing unauthorized users from accessing systems by restricting access privileges.
* Defending against malicious code, such as viruses, worms, and Trojans.
* Developing backup strategies and business continuity plans to ensure that systems maintain acceptable levels of service.
* Measuring service availability in order to identify areas of improvement.

Availability is a key concern in security engineering

## Warning: 

If availability requirements are not met, then the system may suffer from:

- Decreased performance or slow response times
- Outages or downtime
- Higher than expected resource usage
- Lowered security
- Loss of data
- Increased maintenance costs

# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Authorization 

## Authorization: Security Best Practices Guidelines

Authorization refers to the process of determining what users or groups of users are able to access certain resources in a system. Ensuring the appropriate security of authorization processes is an important part of maintaining the privacy and security of systems and data. 

The following are some best practices to help ensure the proper security of authorization processes:

* Implement multiple authentication factors to provide both authorization and identification.
* Regularly monitor and audit user access to data and systems and ensure that access is only granted to the necessary individuals.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when providing user access to systems and data - only provide users with the least level of access necessary to perform their tasks. 
* Follow data segregation and separation of duties to reduce the potential risk of compromised authentication.
* Ensure authorization processes are enforced across all organizational devices and systems.
* Utilize an authorization system that allows for periodic audits and reviews, as well as the ability to track changes.
* Establish protocols and policies that clearly define grant and access management practices.
* Utilize a password management system in order to provide users with secure and easy access to authorization credentials.
* Ensure authorization processes are kept up-to-date with the latest security protocols.
* Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and investigate suspicious activities.
* Provide users and administrators with consistent and continuous authorization training.

# Security Best Practices for Cryptography 

Cryptography is one of the most important tools when it comes to securing sensitive information. The following best practices should be implemented when using cryptography: 

## Key Management 

1. Generate strong cryptographic keys and store them securely. 
2. Back up cryptographic keys regularly in multiple secure locations. 
3. Properly revoke cryptographic keys that will no longer be used.
4. Implement access control measures for cryptographic keys to prevent unauthorized access. 
5. Limit the number of administrators that have access to cryptographic keys.

## Use of Cryptographic Algorithms

1. Use only well-tested cryptographic algorithms and implementations. 
2. Regularly assess and update cryptographic algorithms if they become outdated or vulnerable. 
3. Use strong cryptographic algorithms such as AES and RSA. 
4. Utilize separate cryptographic implementations for different systems for better security.

## Encryption

1. Encrypt data at rest, in transit, and in memory. 
2. Never store unencrypted data or passwords.
3. Ensure secure transmission of data over the network and across systems. 
4. Use separate encryption keys for different systems for better security.

## Security Monitoring

1. Implement proper security monitoring of cryptographic systems.
2. Regularly audit cryptographic systems to ensure that they are secure and compliant.
3. Monitor for unauthorized access to cryptographic keys and systems. 
4. Implement proper incident response measures for security breaches.

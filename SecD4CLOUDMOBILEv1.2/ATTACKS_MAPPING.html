<h1>Man-in-th-Middle Attack</h1>
<p>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is an attack where a threat actor interferes with the communication between two systems. The threat actor inserts itself between the two systems and has access to all the data being sent between them.</p>
<p>MITM attacks are used to steal or modify data in transit, such as banking credentials, passwords, and security tokens. Hackers carry out these attacks by spoofing IP addresses and using malicious code to gain access to unencrypted data. They can also use packet-sniffing software to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
<p>MITM attacks can be done through network-level attacks or application-level attacks. Network-level MITM attacks involve the hacker taking control of the entire communications path between the two hosts. Application level MITM attacks involve the hacker hacking into one of the hosts and manipulating their traffic.</p>
<p>To protect against MITM attacks, it is important to use secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS. It is also important to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted while in transit. Additionally, strong authentication methods should be used to authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Man-in-th-Middle Architectural Risk Analysis:</h2>
<h2>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to intercept and modify data sent between two parties. This attack is especially dangerous as it can be used to intercept sensitive and confidential information. </p>
<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1 measures the risk of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack along four different vectors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attack vector (AV)</strong> : Remote</li>
<li><strong>Attack complexity (AC)</strong>: Low</li>
<li><strong>Privileges required (PR)</strong>: None</li>
<li><strong>User Interaction (UI)</strong>: None</li>
</ol>
<h3>Risk Score</h3>
<p>Based on the risk factors defined above, the risk score for a Man-in-the-Middle attack using CVSS v3.1 is 7.2. This falls under the medium risk category. </p>
<p><strong>Overall Risk Score: 7.2 (Medium)</strong></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/mitmAttackTree.png" /></p>
<h1>Brute Force Attack</h1>
<p>A Brute Force attack is a type of attack that attempts to guess a user's authentication credentials, such as a username and password, by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is discovered. It is commonly used to gain unauthorised access to secure systems.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Brute Force attacks are often used in combination with other tactics, such as dictionary and rainbow table attacks, to increase the chances of success.</p>
<p>In order to protect against this type of attack, it is recommended to use strong authentication credentials that are difficult to guess, such as long, randomised passwords made up of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. It is also a good idea to set a maximum amount of failed log-in attempts before locking out the user account, as this prevents attackers from attempting to guess the credentials indefinitely.</p>

<h1>Eavesdropping Attack</h1>
<p>Eavesdropping attack is a type of network attack in which the attacker listens to the conversations taking place among two or more authorized users or devices on the same network. This attack allows attackers to collect valuable information, including private data and confidential messages, without being detected. </p>
<p>In this attack, the attacker uses various tools to gain access to the target computer's network, such as sniffers, which are essentially network-based packet sniffers that extract data from the network, and Trojan horses, malicious programs that are secretly installed on the system. The attacker can also use other methods to access the network, such as phishing emails, rogue Wi-Fi access points, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Once the attacker gains access to the network, they eavesdrop on the conversations taking place on the network. By monitoring the data packets being sent over the network, the attacker can gain access to sensitive information and data that they can then use for malicious purposes.</p>
<h2>Eavesdropping Architectural Risk Analysis:</h2>
<p><strong>Eavesdropping Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 score for Eavesdropping Vulnerability is 4.8, categorized under 'High' severity.</p>

<p>CVSS v3.1 Vector String: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L</p>
<p><strong>Risk Analysis of Eavesdropping Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>Eavesdropping Vulnerability poses a high risk to the confidentiality of the data traveling within a network as it allows attackers to intercept and potentially access sensitive information. Without any user interaction, an attacker can intercept information and potentially gain unrestricted access to the confidential data, thus leaving the users’ online operations prone to manipulation. Moreover, the integrity and availability of the network can be impacted to a low extent.</p>
<p>Therefore, organizations need to put in place an effective counter-measures strategy which focuses on enhancing data security measures, including the adoption of strong authentication protocols and encryption technologies, to mitigate and reduce the risk of eavesdropping attacks.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/eavesdroppingAttackTree.png" /></p>
<h1>Flooding Attack</h1>
<p>Flooding attacks are attempts to inundate a resource with an overwhelming amount of data or requests in order to overwhelm or crash it. Flooding attacks are often effective when the target resource is limited in bandwidth or processing power, such as a server, and is unable to handle so much data or requests, resulting in performance degradation or service disruption.</p>
<p>Examples of flooding attacks include Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which send an extremely large amount of requests/traffic to the victim’s server or network in order to saturate it and make it incapable of responding to legitimate requests. Additionally, there is also the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, which uses more than one computer or device to send the traffic, making it even more of a challenge to defend against.</p>
<p>Flooding attacks can be difficult to detect and stop as they often involve huge volumes of data. However, some steps to help mitigate the effects of flooding attacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing firewalls and other security measures to detect and block suspicious traffic.</li>
<li>Deploying load balancers to distribute the amount of requests over multiple servers or resources.</li>
<li>Monitoring network and server performance to detect anomalies.</li>
<li>Limiting connection requests from a single source.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sniffing Attack</h1>
<p>Sniffing attack is a type of cyber attack in which attackers gain unauthorized access to a network by using methods to capture, monitor, and control data packets in a network. In this attack, malicious users capture data that is being transmitted over the network, such as usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. This is done by sniffing or intercepting packets of data as they pass through the network and capturing them for further analysis. The attackers can then use the data gathered to gain access to networks or to commit data theft.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Malicious insider vulnerabilities occur when a malicious employee, contractor, or third-party accesses an organization's systems or data and is able to make unauthorized changes or steal confidential information. In this attack scenario, the malicious actor has a high degree of privileges, which allows them to access the systems or data on a large scale. The scope of the attack is changed due to the malicious actor's ability to manipulate the data or systems, and this has a high impact on the organization in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. </p>
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 assesses malicious insider vulnerabilities with a Base Score of 9.8, indicating a Critical severity level. This is further broken down into an Exploitability Subscore of 8.6, and an Impact Subscore of 10.0. Given the privileged access of the malicious actor, the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, and user interaction all factor into the exploitability subscore of 8.6. The scope of the attack and the associated impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system warrant the high Impact Subscore of 10.0.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/maliciousInsiderAttackTree.png" /></p>
<h1>VM Escape Attack</h1>
<p>VM (Virtual Machine) Escape attacks involve compromised VMs that act as an entry point for an intruder to gain access to the larger system. It occurs when attackers use vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escape the confines of a virtual machine and gain access to the underlying physical server or network. Through this attack, attackers can gain control of the physical server and execute malicious activities such as stealing data, disrupting service, and deleting critical files.</p>
<p>These attacks are especially dangerous since they bypass security measures, including firewalls, that are typically in place to protect physical servers and networks. Therefore, it is important for organizations to be vigilant and implement measures to protect against VM escape attacks. One way of doing this is by keeping VMs updated and running the latest security patches. Additionally, limiting the access and privileges of VMs can also help to reduce the attack surface.</p>

<h1>Cryptanalysis Attack</h1>
<p>Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing encrypted data in order to find weaknesses that can be exploited to gain access to the plaintext. It is an incredibly powerful technique that has been used to crack many of the world's most powerful encryption algorithms. Cryptanalysis can be used to attack both symmetric and asymmetric encryption systems. </p>
<p>The goal of cryptanalysis is to gain access to the plaintext without knowing the secret key. It can be done in a variety of ways, such as frequency analysis, differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, brute-force attack, etc. Attackers typically use a combination of these techniques to find a weakness in the security system. </p>
<p>By using cryptanalysis, attackers can gain access to sensitive data without the need to decode the entire encrypted document or message. This makes cryptanalysis an important tool for attackers because it allows them to easily bypass complex encryption schemes.</p>

<p>Byzantine attacks are among the most dangerous security risks and are caused by malicious nodes that cause a distributed system to malfunction. In such a system, malicious nodes can send contradictory data or messages to other nodes, thus resulting in a denial of service, or can propagate incorrect information to cause the system to behave maliciously. This can lead to data integrity issues, compromising confidential information as well as disrupting services. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 assigns a Base Score of 7.2 to a Byzantine attack vulnerability. This score is determined by the parameters listed in the table above.</p>
<p>Attack Vector: The attack vector for such a vulnerability is set to Network (N) as the malicious nodes aim to disrupt the system via networking, or by sending incorrect messages or data over the network.</p>
<p>Attack Complexity: Low (L) is assigned to this vulnerability because it does not require expertise to execute, as the malicious nodes simply need to send incorrect messages.</p>
<p>Privileges Required: Since the malicious nodes do not require any special privileges to propagate incorrect data, the value is set to None (N).</p>
<p>User Interaction: As the attack does not require users to interact or perform any specific actions, the value is set to None (N).</p>
<p>Scope: While the malicious nodes can affect multiple nodes in a system, the scope is unfortunately Unchanged (U), as the malicious nodes do not gain any additional privileges due to the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Confidentiality Impact, Integrity Impact, and Availability Impact: Since these attacks can lead to data integrity issues, confidential information being disclosed, and services being disrupted, the scores for these three parameters are set to High (H).</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/byzantineAttackTree.png" /></p>
<h1>Spectre Attack</h1>
<p>Spectre is a type of side-channel attack that exploits the speculative execution process used by modern computer processors. The attackers are able to extract sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys from the memory of other processes running on the same computer, even if those processes are in the same trusted environment (e.g., a virtual machine (VM)).</p>
<p>Spectre attack exploits a vulnerability in the way modern CPUs execute programs speculatively. Specifically, when the processor encounters a branch instruction during a process, it goes ahead and predicts which branch will be taken and runs the instructions in that branch, even though the branch may not end up being taken after all. This behavior was designed to speed up the execution of programs. However, it can be abused to leak sensitive data in other processes on the same system.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by a technique called "side-channel attack" which works by measuring how long certain instructions take to execute to gain insights into what data the processor is using. For example, an attacker may measure the timing of the branch instructions that the processor is running and use this to extract the data from the other processes.</p>
<p>The danger with Spectre is that this attack technique can be used to extract sensitive data from processes running in a trusted environment, including trusted VMs. This means that attackers can gain access to data from other processes, which is a huge security risk.</p>
<h1>Meltdown Attack</h1>
<p>Meltdown is a security vulnerability in modern processors that can allow malicious applications to access higher privileged memory. It exploits a processor's speculative execution feature to gain access to memory locations that should otherwise be inaccessible. This vulnerability has the potential to expose sensitive information, such as passwords, from the memory of other processes running on the same system.</p>
<p>To mitigate the Meltdown attack, patches must be applied to both software and hardware. The patch helps restrict an application's access to privileged memory and also ensures that memory access violations do not occur. Also, system administrators should update their systems and disable speculative execution if possible.</p>

<h1>RFID Spoofing Injection Attack</h1>
<p>RFID Spoofing attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker uses a fake RFID identifier to gain access to a secured area or system without the right clearance. The malicious entity then uses the fake ID to gain access to resources it wouldn’t normally be able to access. This type of attack can be used to alter a person’s identity or to commit fraud by copying an existing ID or creating a completely new one without the user's knowledge.</p>
<p>This type of attack can be particularly damaging and difficult to detect since the attacker can disguise himself/herself as an existing RFID tag. The attacker can also modify existing RFID tags and manipulate data in order to use them for unauthorized access. </p>
<p>RFID Spoofing attack is a type of attack that is hard to detect because it requires a specialized skillset, making it difficult to correctly identify and stop the attacker. It is important to make sure that all RFID tags are encrypted and that authentication and access control systems are implemented correctly in order to protect against this type of attack.</p>

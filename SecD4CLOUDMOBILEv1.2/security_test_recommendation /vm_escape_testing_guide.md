# Testing the VM Escape Attack 

There are a few approaches to testing for VM Escape (also known as Virtual Machine Escape). 

1. **Code Review**: A comprehensive code review can help identify potential vulnerabilities present in the code which, if exploited, could lead to a VM Escape. This involves a thorough, line-by-line examination of the source code, using techniques such as manual inspection, automated static code analysis and fuzzing.

2. **Exploit Testing**: A series of exploitation techniques can be used to try to break out of the virtualized environment. These could include things such as exploiting buffer and account overflow vulnerabilities, command injection and malicious software attempts.

3. **Penetration Testing**: Penetration testing involves the use of specialized tools and techniques to break into the virtual environment and gain access to critical resources. This could involve standard methods such as brute force attacks, port scanning, and social engineering.

4. **External Auditing**: External auditing involves examining the operating environment from the outside, examining access controls, security protocols and other measures. This can identify any weak points that would allow for a successful VM Escape.

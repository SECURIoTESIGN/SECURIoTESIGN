# Testing the Cellular Rogue Base Station Attack 

1. **Install** the necessary equipment: 
    - A cellular network access point (e.g., a mobile modem, a femtocell, or a base station simulator) 
    - An attack station (e.g., a laptop or a Raspberry Pi with a cellular modem) 
    - Software to generate and monitor rogue base station (e.g., KARMA)
2. **Test the equipment** by running standard tests to ensure that everything is working correctly.
3. **Enable KARMA** and configure the system settings to simulate a rogue base station.
4. **Run a scan** of the local environment to identify any other base stations that may be present and respond to rogue transmissions.
5. **Transmit Rogue Base Station Signals** over the local environment to detect any client devices that may be present.
6. **Monitor the response** of any detected devices to confirm that they are connecting to the rogue base station.
7. **Analyze the data** collected from the scan and the response of the devices to confirm whether or not the attack was successful.
8. **Document results** of the test and any other data collected to provide a comprehensive record of the attack.

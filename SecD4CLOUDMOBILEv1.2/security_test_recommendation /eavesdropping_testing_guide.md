# Testing the Eavesdropping Attack 

Testing Eavesdropping attacks typically involve the following steps:

1. Set up the environment: 
   - Choose a testing tool (ie Wireshark, Cain & Abel, etc)
   - Configure the network 

2. Launch the attack:
   - Use the chosen tool to monitor the traffic on the network
   - Search for unencrypted data in transit 

3. Analyze the results: 
   - Investigate any suspicious packets to identify any confidential information
   - Review the logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts

4. Document the results: 
   - Document any discovered confidential data and unauthorized access attempts 
   - Present the analysis findings in a clear, organized format (Markdown is a great option) 
   
5. Prevent further attacks:
   - Leverage the findings to identify any security vulnerabilities in the network 
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect against future eavesdropping attempts

# Biometric Authentication Mechanisms 

Biometric authentication mechanisms in cloud-based mobile apps are methods of authentication relying on the physiological characteristics of a user as a method of accessing the device or application. Examples of popular biometric authentication technologies available for cloud-based mobile devices are fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and voice recognition. These technologies use advanced algorithms to validate a userâ€™s identity based on the physiological traits unique to each individual. By using these methods, companies and app developers can increase the security of their cloud services while preventing unauthorized access.

## Biometric Authentication Mechanisms Examples: 

|Security Requirement|Mobile Platform|Mechanism|Description|OSI Layer|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Authentication & Access Control|Android|Facial Recognition|Hardware based biometric authentication that uses the device front facing camera to snap a picture of the user's face and match it against stored images|Application|
|Authentication & Access Control|iOS|Voice Recognition |Software based biometric authentication that uses the device microphone and internal software to capture the user's voice and match it against stored audio |Application|
|Encryption & Decryption|Android|2-Factor Authentication with PIN & Pattern |Combined hardware and software based authentication that requires the user to enter a PIN and draw a pattern on a defined pattern grid. |Presentation |
|Encryption & Decryption |iOS|Retina Recognition |Hardware based biometric authentication that uses the device front facing camera to obtain a high-resolution picture of the user's eye and matches it against stored images |Application|
|IDS & IPS |Android|Fingerprint Scan|Hardware based biometric authentication that uses the device built-in fingerprint scanner to scan the user's fingerprint and match it against stored images |Application|
|IDS & IPS |iOS|3-Factor Authentication with PIN, Pattern & Password|Combined hardware and software-based authentication that requires the user to enter a PIN, draw a pattern on a defined pattern grid, and enter a password|Presentation|

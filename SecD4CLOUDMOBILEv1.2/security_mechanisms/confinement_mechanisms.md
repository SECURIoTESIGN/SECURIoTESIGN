# Confinement Mechanisms 

Security Confinement Mechanisms in Cloud-based mobile apps refer to the various measures put in place by app developers to help ensure the security and integrity of data within the app. These mechanisms might include measures like authentication requirements, security protocols, encryption, tokenization, application sandboxing, and isolated virtual machines. These measures help limit the risk of data theft or compromise within a cloud-based mobile application.

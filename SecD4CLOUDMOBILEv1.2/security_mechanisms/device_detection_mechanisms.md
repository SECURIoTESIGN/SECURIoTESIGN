# Device Detection Mechanisms 

Security Device Detection Mechanisms in Cloud-based mobile apps are technologies responsible for detecting the mobile device that is used to access the application. The mechanisms can vary from OS-level or device-level properties and can include biometrics such as facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and voice recognition. These mechanisms allow cloud-based mobile apps to detect the device used and ensure that only authorized devices are able to access the app, providing an extra level of security against potential malicious activity.

## Device Detection Mechanisms Examples: 

| Security Requirement | Mobile Platform | Mechanism  | Description  | OSI Layer  |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Coding Phase | iOS | Mobile App Wrapping | A tool used to secure enterprise apps | Application |
| Coding Phase | Android | App Reverse Engineering Protection | A technique used to protect code from reverse engineering | Application |
| Runtime | iOS | Jailbreak Detection | Detects if the device is jailbroken or not |   Application |
| Runtime | Android | Root Detection | Detection of rooted devices | Application |

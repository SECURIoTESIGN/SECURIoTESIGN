# Security Audit Mechanisms 

A Security Audit Mechanism is an automated or manual process which evaluates cloud-based mobile apps for security issues. It may include verifying the integrity of the code, inspecting system configurations, testing user authentication and authorization controls, and ensuring that the system is following best practices such as encryption, patching, and regular system updates. A Security Audit Mechanism can also identify potential security weaknesses and provide recommendations for mitigating these. Furthermore, a Security Audit Mechanism can perform performance and reliability checks, as well as other security checks such as penetration testing, infrastructure testing, and security vulnerability scanning. By utilizing these security audit mechanisms, organizations can ensure their cloud-based mobile apps are safe and secure.

## Audit Mechanisms Examples:

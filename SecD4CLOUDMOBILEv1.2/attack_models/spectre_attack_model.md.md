## Arquitectural Risk Analysis of Spectre Attack Vulnerability

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1

According to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1, Spectre Attack Vulnerability has the following ratings:

- **Base score:** 6.1
- **Attack vector:** Local
- **Attack complexity:** High
- **Privileges required:** Low
- **User interaction:** None
- **Scope:** Unchanged
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High
- **Integrity Impact:** High
- **Availability Impact:** Low

**Conclusion:** With a base score of 6.1, the Spectre Attack Vulnerability carries a medium-severity risk from a local attack. The attack's high complexity mitigates the attack; however, this attack still carries a high confidentiality and integrity impact despite its lower availability impact.

Spectre attack vulnerabilities can present an important risk to any system architectures that are susceptible to them. The CVSS score of 6.5 / 10.0 is indicative of the potential risk present. With an attack vector of network, the attack complexity of low, no privileges required, and required user interaction, the confidentiality of the system can be compromised. It is important to note that the integrity and availability of the system may not be affected, but the confidentiality of the system is still at risk. As such, measures should be taken to ensure that any Spectre attack vulnerabilities are properly addressed.

## Response

A comprehensive security plan should be implemented to protect against Spectre attacks. 

The first step is to create a data protection policy and set up systems that identify taint checks performed on data. Systems such as intrusion detection should be set up to identify any attempts to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data. Acceptable use policies should also be established to ensure that employees do not engage in activities that can lead to attacks. 

Organizations should also provide employees with training to help them recognize social engineering attacks and to identify malicious software attempts. They should also use techniques such as two-factor authentication to strengthen their authentication process and limit lateral movement attempts. 

Finally, organizations should use cryptographic techniques such as encryption and hashing to protect their data. They should also monitor their systems for signs of compromised data and crypt

Spectre is an attack vulnerability that exploits vulnerabilities in out-of-order execution, a feature found in most modern processors. It is based on a side-channel attack and relies on a microarchitectural implementation of speculative execution. This attack allows an attacker to read data in the processor's memory, such as secret keys, passwords, and other sensitive information. The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass memory isolation and protections, such as ASLR, DEP, and other unwanted access to data. 

The architectural risk of Spectre Attack Vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to and exploit sensitive data in memory. This can have serious repercussions, such as data theft or modification of data, which can lead to data loss or corruption. Furthermore, Spectre affects a wide range of modern processors which can lead to widespread exploitation of this vulnerability.

## Spectre Architectural Risk Analysis 

## Architectural Risk Analysis of Spectre Attack Vulnerability (According to CVSS v3.1)

### Base Score: 9.3 

A successful exploit of the Spectre Attack Vulnerability would allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive data stored within memory and can cause a system crash. This is considered a high-risk vulnerability and this risk can be amplified by the ease of access and ease of exploitation.

### Exploitability (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

The Spectre Attack Vulnerability has a very low attack vector, requiring little to no user interaction (UI:N), making it fairly easy to exploit (AV:L). It also has a high level of complexity (AC:H) as well as a high level of privilege required for exploitation (PR:N). Additionally, the scope of vulnerability (S:U) is considered to be unchanged, meaning that any data stored in memory is at risk. Furthermore, the availability of attack complexity (C:H), the impact of the attack (I:H), as well as the attack vector (A:H) are all considered high.

### Impact (C:H/I:H/A:H)

The impact of exploits of the Spectre Attack Vulnerability is very high. Not only can attackers gain access to sensitive data stored inside memory (C:H), but they can also cause a system crash (I:H) and potentially steal credentials or perform malicious activities (A:H).

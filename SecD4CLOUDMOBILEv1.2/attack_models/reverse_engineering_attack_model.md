# Reverse Engineering Attack 

Reverse engineering attack is an attack that attempts to recreate the source code of a system from its object code. This type of attack is often used to gain unauthorized access to an application or system by recreating the security measures and mechanisms present in the object code. Reverse engineering attacks are particularly dangerous since they allow attackers to uncover hidden flaws, backdoors and vulnerabilities that can be used to gain access to the system.

## Architectural Risk Analysis of Reverse Engineering Attack Vulnerability

Under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1, reverse engineering attack vulnerability is assigned a score of 7.0 out of 10.0.

The following factors contribute to the score:

**Attack Vector (AV):** Remote

**Attack Complexity (AC):** Low

**Privileges Required (PR):** None

**User Interaction (UI):** None

**Scope (S):** Changed

**Confidentiality Impact (C):** High

**Integrity Impact (I):** Low

**Availability Impact (A):** Low


This means that a successful reverse engineering attack is possible to launch from a remote location, with low complexity required. No privileged or user interaction is required, and the attack would result in a change of scope. Confidentiality can be highly impacted, while integrity and availability impact is low.

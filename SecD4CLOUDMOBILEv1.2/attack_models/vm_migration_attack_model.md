# VM Migration Attack 

VM (Virtual Machine) Migration Attack is an attack in which an attacker takes advantage of the flaw in a VM system by transferring or migrating malicious codes or payloads from one system to another. This type of attack is used to exploit vulnerabilities in the security configuration of the system, and can cause data theft, destruction of files, network disruption, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and even complete system takeover. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it is difficult to detect, and the malicious payloads can travel through the VM system without being recognized or stopped.

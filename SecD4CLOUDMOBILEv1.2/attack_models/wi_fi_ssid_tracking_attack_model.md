# Wi-Fi SSID Tracking Attack 

Wi-Fi SSID tracking attack is an attack in which malicious actors use techniques such as tracking the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses or the Service Set Identifier (SSID) of a device to capture user data transmitted through a wireless network. This type of attack has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity and the fact that it can be used to target multiple devices in a network. The attack can be used to steal sensitive data such as credit card information and other personal details that are sent through the network. It can also be used to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.  

Overall, Wi-Fi SSID tracking attack is a threat that should be taken seriously as it can have serious implications on user security. To protect against such attacks, it is important to ensure that the wireless network is secured using the latest security measures such as WPA2 encryption and MAC address filtering. Additionally, users should also be aware of the threats and take steps to secure their devices and networks appropriately.

## Wi-Fi SSID Tracking Architectural Risk Analysis: 

**Wi-Fi SSID Tracking Attack Vulnerability**

CVSS v3.1 Scoring: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (AV:N): The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without requiring user interaction or authentication. 

**Attack Complexity (AC)**: High (AC:H): Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The attack can be initiated by any source.

**Privileges Required (PR)**: None (PR:N): No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**User Interaction (UI)**: None (UI:N): The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Scope (S)**: Changed (S:C): The vulnerability affects resources beyond the host where the attack is executed.

**Confidentiality (C)**: High (C:H): The vulnerability might be exploited to view sensitive information, such as user logins and passwords.

**Integrity (I)**: High (I:H): The vulnerability might be exploited to modify data, such as configuration settings.

**Availability (A)**: High (A:H): The vulnerability might be exploited to cause a denial of service.

# Malicious Insider Attack 

Malicious insider attack is when a person with authorized access to an organization's systems and networks misuses their privileges to damage the organization's information systems, applications or data. This type of attack can lead to complete system or network shutdown, data theft, fraud or other malicious activities. 

The malicious insider threat is one of the most difficult threats to detect because the insider has legitimate access and is part of the organization which makes it hard to identify the malicious activity. Some of the most preventative measures organizations can take to mitigate against malicious insider attacks are: 

* Implement strong access control policies and guidelines.
* Ensure that users access only the information necessary for them to perform their job duties.
* Limit user privileges on systems and applications.
* Implement thorough background checks for new employees and contractors. 
* Monitor system and user activities for abnormal behavior.
* Securely manage and monitor privileged accounts, user credentials, and authentication protocols.
* Automate system security compliance.

**Description**

Malicious insider vulnerabilities occur when a malicious employee, contractor, or third-party accesses an organization's systems or data and is able to make unauthorized changes or steal confidential information. In this attack scenario, the malicious actor has a high degree of privileges, which allows them to access the systems or data on a large scale. The scope of the attack is changed due to the malicious actor's ability to manipulate the data or systems, and this has a high impact on the organization in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 assesses malicious insider vulnerabilities with a Base Score of 9.8, indicating a Critical severity level. This is further broken down into an Exploitability Subscore of 8.6, and an Impact Subscore of 10.0. Given the privileged access of the malicious actor, the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, and user interaction all factor into the exploitability subscore of 8.6. The scope of the attack and the associated impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system warrant the high Impact Subscore of 10.0.

# SMS-of-Death Attacks

In short, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to execute a browser script bypassing access control mechanisms such as the same origin policy.


** Definition **

Being an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications, the attacker in this type of attack executes malicious database claims, exploiting improper validation of data flowing from the user to the database. The attacker's goal is to access the intended party's confidential data by inserting malicious code into the user's web page in order to redirect them to their site. There are two ways to forge this type of attack:
  
 * Stored XSS (uninterruptedly stores malicious code in a resource managed by the web application);
 * Reflective XSS (promptly reflects malicious code against the user and therefore does not store it permanently;
 * XSS based on DOM (Document Object Model).

** Attacker Powers **

 * Circumvent the policy of same origin;
 * Impersonate you to websites and / or web applications you regularly use by obtaining / altering / destroying various types of content.

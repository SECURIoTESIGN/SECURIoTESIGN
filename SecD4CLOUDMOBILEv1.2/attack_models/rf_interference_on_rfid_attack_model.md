# RF Interference on RFIDs Attack 

RF interference on RFIDs is the interference caused by various external sources in the radio frequency signals being sent and received by RFID tags. It can be caused by external radio waves from nearby objects like Wi-Fi networks, cellular towers, and broadcast towers. It can also be caused by certain materials like water, metal, and concrete which can block or absorb the radio frequency signals. RF interference can drastically reduce the range and accuracy of an RFID tag and significantly degrade overall performance.

# Hardware Integrity Attack 

Hardware Integrity is the assurance that hardware components are functioning as expected and have not been tampered with or compromised. It is essential to ensuring secure data transmission and verifying the accuracy of input and output.

The goal of hardware integrity is to protect the trustworthiness of the hardware system by safeguarding against corruption or unauthorized modification. This includes protecting physical components, verifying digital signatures, authenticating communication channels, and other measures that can detect and prevent malicious activity.

Hardware integrity is a vital security measure for any type of system or network, as it helps to ensure that data remains safe and secure from external threats.

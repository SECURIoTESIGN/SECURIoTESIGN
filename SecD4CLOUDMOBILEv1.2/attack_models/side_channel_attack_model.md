# Side-Channel Attack 

Side-channel attacks are a class of security exploits that target physical implementation of systems, such as the way data is stored, transmitted, and processed, rather than exploiting logical flaws in the system itself. These attacks use unintentional information leakage from a system’s physical implementation—such as processor or memory timing, power consumption, radio frequency (RF) emission, or the sound similar systems make—to gain insights into the system’s internals and the data it is processing. Such leaked information can be used by an adversary to reverse engineer the system’s implementation, compromising its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

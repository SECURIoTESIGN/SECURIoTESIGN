# Cellular Jamming Attack 

Cellular Jamming attacks are a type of cyber attack where a malicious actor attempts to interrupt communication signals and prevent devices from being able to communicate with each other. In these attacks, malicious actors will use a transmitter to interfere with cellular, Wi-Fi, and other communication frequencies so that cellular communication is disrupted, preventing the targeted device from sending and receiving data. This can be used to disrupt any type of information, ranging from financial information to sensitive documents. In addition, cellular jamming attacks can also be used to prevent people from accessing the Internet, utilizing GPS navigation, and using their phones and other connected devices.

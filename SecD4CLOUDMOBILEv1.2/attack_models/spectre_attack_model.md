# Spectre Attack 

Spectre is a type of side-channel attack that exploits the speculative execution process used by modern computer processors. The attackers are able to extract sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys from the memory of other processes running on the same computer, even if those processes are in the same trusted environment (e.g., a virtual machine (VM)).

Spectre attack exploits a vulnerability in the way modern CPUs execute programs speculatively. Specifically, when the processor encounters a branch instruction during a process, it goes ahead and predicts which branch will be taken and runs the instructions in that branch, even though the branch may not end up being taken after all. This behavior was designed to speed up the execution of programs. However, it can be abused to leak sensitive data in other processes on the same system.

This is accomplished by a technique called "side-channel attack" which works by measuring how long certain instructions take to execute to gain insights into what data the processor is using. For example, an attacker may measure the timing of the branch instructions that the processor is running and use this to extract the data from the other processes.

The danger with Spectre is that this attack technique can be used to extract sensitive data from processes running in a trusted environment, including trusted VMs. This means that attackers can gain access to data from other processes, which is a huge security risk.

# Sniffing Attack 

Sniffing attack is a type of cyber attack in which attackers gain unauthorized access to a network by using methods to capture, monitor, and control data packets in a network. In this attack, malicious users capture data that is being transmitted over the network, such as usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. This is done by sniffing or intercepting packets of data as they pass through the network and capturing them for further analysis. The attackers can then use the data gathered to gain access to networks or to commit data theft.

# Cryptanalysis Attack 

Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing encrypted data in order to find weaknesses that can be exploited to gain access to the plaintext. It is an incredibly powerful technique that has been used to crack many of the world's most powerful encryption algorithms. Cryptanalysis can be used to attack both symmetric and asymmetric encryption systems. 

The goal of cryptanalysis is to gain access to the plaintext without knowing the secret key. It can be done in a variety of ways, such as frequency analysis, differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, brute-force attack, etc. Attackers typically use a combination of these techniques to find a weakness in the security system. 

By using cryptanalysis, attackers can gain access to sensitive data without the need to decode the entire encrypted document or message. This makes cryptanalysis an important tool for attackers because it allows them to easily bypass complex encryption schemes.

# Cryptanalysis Vulnerability

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.8 (high severity)**

**Scope: Changed**

**Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

## Attack Vector (AV):
AV:N - Network: The vulnerability is exploitable with network access.

## Attack Complexity (AC):
AC:L - Low: Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist.

## Privileges Required (PR):
PR:H - High: The attacker must have high privileges on system or access to significant resources.

## User Interaction (UI):
UI:N - None: No user interaction is required. 

## Scope (S):
S:U - Changed: The attack changes the scope of the vulnerability by exploiting a vulnerability in a different context or a different system.

## Confidentiality Impact (C):
C:H - High: There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed.

## Integrity Impact (I):
I:H - High: There is a total compromise of system integrity.

## Availability Impact (A):
A:H - High: There is a total shutdown of the affected resource.

## Overall Severity:

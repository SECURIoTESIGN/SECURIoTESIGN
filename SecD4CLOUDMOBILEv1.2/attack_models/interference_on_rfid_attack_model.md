# RF Interference on RFIDs

## Overview 

RF Interference on RFIDs attack is a type of attack that disrupts the communication between RFID tags and readers by generating unwanted signals in the same frequency band. This can cause performance degradation, misinterpretation, or loss of information for the RFID system. RF interference can be caused by natural or manmade sources, such as lightning, solar flares, power lines, microwave ovens, or other wireless devices. It can also be caused by intentional jamming operations that aim to prevent or sabotage the RFID system.

RF interference attacks aim to disrupt or block the communication between the RFID reader and the RFID tag, thereby preventing the successful reading or writing of data. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the RFID system's communication protocols and can have various motivations, including unauthorized access, data theft, or sabotage.

The CVSS Base Score for the RF interference on RFIDs vulnerability is 7.5 (High). It reflects the impact on the availability of the RFID system while indicating that there is no direct impact on confidentiality or integrity.

It is essential for organizations to address this vulnerability by implementing appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the risks associated with RF interference attacks. Countermeasures may include frequency hopping, encryption, authentication, and signal monitoring. These measures can help reduce the likelihood and impact of successful exploits, enhancing the security and reliability of RFID systems.

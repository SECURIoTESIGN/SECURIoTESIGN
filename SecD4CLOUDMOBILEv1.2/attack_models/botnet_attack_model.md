# Botnet Attack 

A **Botnet attack** is the use of malware to create an army of compromised computers, called "bots", to remotely control them to carry out malicious activities. These activities can include sending large amounts of spam email, launching Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and even stealing confidential information from unsuspecting victims. Botnets can be used to target a single system or can be used to launch devastating attacks against large networks or government databases.

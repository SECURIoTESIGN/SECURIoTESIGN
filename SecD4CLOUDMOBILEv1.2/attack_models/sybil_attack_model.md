# Sybil Attack 

## Sybil Attack

A Sybil attack is a type of attack on a peer-to-peer network, where a malicious user or system attempts to control a large portion of the network by creating multiple fake nodes. This type of attack takes advantage of the trust relationships within the network and can allow the malicious user to disrupt communication, steal data, and control a large part of the network.

Sybil attack vulnerability is one of the most critical threats that can severely affect the core functionality of an organizations' IT network. A Sybil attack, also known as false peer attack, occurs when a malicious actor connects to a system or network, creating multiple virtual identities by spoofing specialized credentials. This spoofing of multiple identities allows them to launch attacks such as DDOS, access confidential data, or interfere in the operations of the system, thus increasing the vulnerability of the network. 

The CVSS v3.1 score of 7.6 for this vulnerability reflects the severity of the issue. The Attack Vector score of Network (N) implies that the vulnerability can be exploitable from a remote source. The Attack Complexity score of High (H) implies that a user with certain technical skill-set should be able to craft the attack successfully. The Privileges Required score of None (N) implies that the attack can be launched with just the access to a network. The User Interaction score of None (N) implies that it does not require any user interaction. The Scope score of Unchange (U) implies that the attack would not lead to any change in the privileges or operation of the system. The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) scores of High (H) imply that this attack could have severe implications on the security of the system by affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive data.

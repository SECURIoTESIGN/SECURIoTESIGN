# Phishing Attack 

Phishing is a type of cyber attack that uses social engineering tactics to steal data and information from unsuspecting victims. It is an attempt to unlawfully obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by impersonating a trusted entity. Phishing attacks can be launched through email, instant message, text messages, or malicious websites.

In order to avoid a phishing attack, users should be wary of any e-mail they receive from an unknown sender, as most phishing attempts come in the form of an email. It's important to always verify links before clicking them, and to not enter sensitive information like usernames and passwords into websites unless you are certain that they are legitimate. Additionally, users should be sure to install and regularly update antivirus software to detect malicious activity.

# Architectural Risk Analysis of Phishing Vulnerability (CVSS v3.1)

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework for communicating the severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS v3.1 is the latest version of CVSS, released in June 2019.

## Base Score:

The base score for a phishing vulnerability is 7.5 out of 10 for CVSS v3.1. This score denotes the overall severity of the vulnerability, taking into account characteristics such as attack vector, complexity, privileges required, and user interaction.  

## Temporal Score:

The temporal score measures the current exploitability of the vulnerability over time. A temporal score of 6.5 is assigned to phishing vulnerability for CVSS v3.1. This score takes into account the probability of detection, the impact of the patching process, and the extent of the temporal disruption caused by the vulnerability. 

## Environmental Score:

The environmental score reflects the environment in which the vulnerability exists, taking into account characteristics such as network size, detection capability, customer usage, and attack scope. A phishing vulnerability can be given an environmental score of 8.5 out of 10 for CVSS v3.1. 

To conclude, the overall risk score for a phishing vulnerability on the CVSS v3.1 scale is 7.5/6.5/8.5. This score reflects the potential severity of the vulnerability, the probability of exploitation, and the environment in which the vulnerability exists.

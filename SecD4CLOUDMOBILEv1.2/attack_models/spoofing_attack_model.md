# Spoofing Attack 

Spoofing is a method of attack in which a malicious actor successfully masquerades as a legitimate user or node in a computer network. Spoofing attacks occur when an attacker makes it appear as though their network traffic is coming from a trusted source while they carry out malicious activities. By spoofing the source of the traffic, attackers can launch attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, phishing attacks, network sniffing attacks, and more. It is important to recognize and be aware of spoofing attacks so as to protect yourself from potential threats.

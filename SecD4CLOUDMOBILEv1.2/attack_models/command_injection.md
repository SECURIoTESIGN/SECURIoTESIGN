# Command Injection Attacks

This type of attack targets unvalidated and not properly sanitised user input, aiming to compromise the normal execution of a web application by causing an unintended exit. E.g., "an SQL Command injection attack occurs when a malicious user, through specifically crafted input, causes a web application to generate and send a query that functions differently than the programmer intended".


## Definition

This is a class of attacks to which web applications are susceptible, resulting from the semantic gap existing between database interpretation and web application interpretation, as well as from the inappropriate handling of user input. The negative technical impact of this type of attack is the execution of unauthorised commands, thus affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. There are several variants of this type of attack:

* LDAP Injection;
* IMAP/SMTP Command Injection;
* XML Injection;
* Manipulating Writeable Terminal Devices;
* SQL Injectio; 
* NoSQL Injection;
* OS Command Injection. 
 
## Technical Impact or Attack Powers

* Modify and Read Data;
* Gain Privileges;
* Bypass Protection Mechanism;
* Unreliable Execution; 
* Execute Unauthorized Commands.

## Risk Analysis
  * Critical Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit
  * High.
 
## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Command Injection attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

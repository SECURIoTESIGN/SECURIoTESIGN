# GPS Jamming Attack 

GPS Jamming attack is a type of cyberattack where an adversary uses electronic jamming devices to interfere with or even disable GPS signals. These devices can be used to disrupt communication between GPS receivers and satellites, making it difficult or even impossible to get accurate location data from the system. This type of attack can pose a serious threat to critical infrastructure and navigation systems that rely on GPS for navigation. 

GPS jamming can be used to disrupt navigation, communication, or surveillance activities that rely on the GPS system. It has been used in corporate espionage and data theft, or as a form of information warfare.

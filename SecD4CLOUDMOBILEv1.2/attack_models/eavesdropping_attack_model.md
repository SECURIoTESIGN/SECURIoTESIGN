# Eavesdropping Attack 

Eavesdropping attack is a type of network attack in which the attacker listens to the conversations taking place among two or more authorized users or devices on the same network. This attack allows attackers to collect valuable information, including private data and confidential messages, without being detected. 

In this attack, the attacker uses various tools to gain access to the target computer's network, such as sniffers, which are essentially network-based packet sniffers that extract data from the network, and Trojan horses, malicious programs that are secretly installed on the system. The attacker can also use other methods to access the network, such as phishing emails, rogue Wi-Fi access points, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Once the attacker gains access to the network, they eavesdrop on the conversations taking place on the network. By monitoring the data packets being sent over the network, the attacker can gain access to sensitive information and data that they can then use for malicious purposes.

**Risk Analysis of Eavesdropping Vulnerability**

Eavesdropping Vulnerability poses a high risk to the confidentiality of the data traveling within a network as it allows attackers to intercept and potentially access sensitive information. Without any user interaction, an attacker can intercept information and potentially gain unrestricted access to the confidential data, thus leaving the usersâ€™ online operations prone to manipulation. Moreover, the integrity and availability of the network can be impacted to a low extent.
 
Therefore, organizations need to put in place an effective counter-measures strategy which focuses on enhancing data security measures, including the adoption of strong authentication protocols and encryption technologies, to mitigate and reduce the risk of eavesdropping attacks.

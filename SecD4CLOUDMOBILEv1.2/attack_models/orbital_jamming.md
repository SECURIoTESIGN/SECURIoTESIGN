# Orbital Jamming Attacks

This is a DoS attack that targets the communication satellites, using a rogue uplink station to disrupt the intended transmission, aiming to make this service unavailable to users of the target mobile devices.

## Definition

 This type of attack targets low-orbit satellites because, although these low-orbit satellites are attractive due to the low power levels required for communications links from terrestrial terminals, they can also be vulnerable to jamming attacks when used in some applications. In fact, a jammer of reasonable power could easily saturate the RF front-end of a low-orbit satellite, resulting in disabling the link across the entire frequency band. 
 
## Technical Impact

 * Service unavailability.

## Typical Severity

 * High

## Risk Analysis

 * High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

 * Low.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Orbital Jamming attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

# RFID Cloning Injection Attack 

RFID Cloning Attack is a type of attack in which an attacker can copy the data stored in an RFID (radio frequency identification) tag or device, such as a passport, credit card, or access card, for unauthorized usage. The attacker uses an RFID reader to intercept the communication between the RFID device and the legitimate reader, allowing the attacker to extract the stored data. This data can then be used to forge a duplicate RFID tag or device with cloned information, which can then be used for fraud or other malicious activities.

# RFID Cloning Attack Vulnerability : Architectural Risk Analysis

Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1 (CVSS v3.1) provides a score to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities. The following is an architectural risk analysis of an RFID cloning attack vulnerability using CVSS v3.1. 

Base Score: 8.6

## Impact Score (6.4)

**Confidentiality Impact**: High (C:H)

An RFID cloning attack can allowed attackers to gain access to sensitive and confidential information stored on the RFID tag.

**Integrity Impact**: Medium (I:M)

An RFID cloning attack can allow attackers to modify data stored on the RFID tag, potentially leading to data corruption.

**Availability Impact**: Low (A:L)

An RFID cloning attack can lead to the RFID tag becoming temporarily unavailable, but is unlikely to result in permanent unavailability.

## Exploitability Score (2.2)

**Attack Vector**: Physical (AV:P)

An RFID cloning attack requires physical access to the device.

**Attack Complexity**: Low (AC:L)

The complexity of the attack is low, as the attack requires no specialized knowledge or tooling. 

**Privileges Required**: None (PR:N)

The attacker does not need any special privileges to carry out the attack.

**User Interaction**: None (UI:N)

No user interaction is required in order to initiate and carry out the attack. 

## Scope Score (1.4)

**Changed Scope**: Unchanged (S:U)

The attack does not involve any changes to the scope of the vulnerability, as it does not affect or alter the system in any way.

## Remediation Level Score (1) 

**Remediation Level**: Official Fix (RL:OF)

An official and permanent fix is available for the vulnerability.

## Report Confidence Score (1)

**Confidence**: Confirmed (RC:C)

The vulnerability has been independently confirmed and reproduced.

# Testing the NFC Payment Replay Attack

One way to test for NFC payment replay attacks is by detecting anomalous data. Markov Chain is one method that can be used to detect relay attacks that occur in electronic payments using NFC. The result shows Markov chain can detect anomalies in relay attacks in the case of electronic payment².

## Testing Tool

One tool that can be used for testing NFC Payment Replay Attack is **NFC Copy Cat**. It is a small device that combines two powerful cybersecurity tools, **NFCopy** and **MagSpoof**. NFCopy works by reading or emulating an NFC card; depending on the necessities of the researcher. On the other hand, MagSpoof can wirelessly emulate/spoof any magnetic stripe card. So using NFC Copy Cat, the user will have a device capable of storing magnetic stripe data or NFC payment data to be replayed later — known in the cybersecurity world as a replay attack¹.

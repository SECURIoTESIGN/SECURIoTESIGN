# Testing the Bluejacking Attack 

Testing a Bluejacking attack consists of the following steps:

1. Identify potential targets in the area: Look for nearby Bluetooth devices that are turned on and discoverable.

2. Connect to the target device: Establish a Bluetooth connection with the targeted device. 

3. Send the message: Send a short message or link to the target device using the deviceâ€™s Bluetooth sharing protocol.

4. Monitor the response: Observe if the target device responds to the message.

5. Analyze the response: Analyze the response from the target device to determine if the attack was successful.

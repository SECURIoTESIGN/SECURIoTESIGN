# Cellular Jamming Attacks Testing

Cellular jamming disrupts wireless communication by interfering with radio signals. Here’s what you need to know:

## Jamming Techniques

1. **Wideband Jamming**: Covers a broad frequency range.
2. **Narrowband Jamming**: Targets specific frequencies.
3. **Pulsed Jamming**: Intermittently disrupts signals.
4. **Continuous Jamming**: Sustained interference.

## Testing Cellular Jamming

1. **Laboratory Testing**: Use controlled environments to assess jamming effects.
2. **Field Testing**: Evaluate real-world scenarios.
3. **Tools**: Custom-built jammers or software-defined radios (SDRs).

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Frequency Hopping**: Cellular systems that change frequencies dynamically.
2. **Spread Spectrum Techniques**: Distribute signal energy across a wide bandwidth.
3. **Authentication and Encryption**: Secure communication channels.
4. **Jammer Detection**: Monitor for jamming signals.

# Testing the Man-in-the-Middle Attack 

### Testing Man-in-the-Middle Attack

1. Set up a virtual network using a virtual machine or other virtual environment.

2. Place a malicious node between two unsuspecting hosts within the same network.

3. Configure the malicious node to intercept and redirect all traffic it receives from the unsuspecting hosts.

4. Verify that the malicious node is effectively intercepting the data, by attempting to ping or connect to one of the unsuspecting hosts.

5. Attempt to gain access to data that is flowing through the malicious node.

6. Monitor the node for malicious activity.

7. Analyze the data logs to identify any suspicious activity.

7. Remove the malicious node from the environment.

8. Change any credentials, passwords, or other information that was intercepted.

9. Monitor the environment for any further malicious activity.

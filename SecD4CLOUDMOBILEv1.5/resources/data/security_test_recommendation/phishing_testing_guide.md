# Testing the Phishing Attack 

1. Create a mock Phishing website: Create a fake website that looks and behaves like the real one in order to fool users into providing their login credentials or other sensitive information. 
2. Set up traffic monitoring: Monitor incoming traffic to your website to ensure that the fake site isn’t receiving any legitimate requests.
3. Analyze the behavior of malicious users: Monitor user behavior on your site and look for any suspicious activity that may indicate a potential attack.
4. Send out test emails: Send out phishing emails to members of your staff and monitor their responses. If the email is opened and a link is clicked, you can be sure that your staff needs more education on Phishing attacks.
5. Analyze the results: Once all of the test emails have been sent out and the responses analyzed, prepare a report outlining what worked and what didn’t.

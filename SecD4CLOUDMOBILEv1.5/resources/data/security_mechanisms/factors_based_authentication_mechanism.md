# Factors-based Authentication Mechanisms 

Factors-based authentication mechanisms in cloud-based mobile apps are methods used to securely access digital resources. They involve the use of two or more authentication factors, such as something that a user knows (e.g., a password), something that a user has (e.g., an authentication code sent to a mobile device), and/or something that a user is (e.g., a biometric scan). Factors-based authentication can help protect mobile apps by providing an extra layer of security, making it less likely that someone unauthorized can access sensitive user data.

## Factors-based Authentication Mechanisms Examples: 

Security Requirement | Mobile Platform | Mechanism | Description | OSI Layer | To Use
------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------
Data Security  | iOS  | Two-factor authentication  | Confirming identity by combination of two unique factors  | Application | Coding Phase and Runtime
Privacy        | Android    | Biometric authentication | Confirming identity by using biometric methods  | Application  | Coding Phase and Runtime
Account Access | iOS  | User ID & Password      | Confirming identity by using combination of user ID and password | Application  | Coding Phase and Runtime

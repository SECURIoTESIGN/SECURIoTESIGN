# Cryptographic Protocols Authentication Mechanisms 

Cryptographic protocols mechanisms for cloud-based mobile apps refer to the cryptographic techniques used to protect data and communications between user devices and cloud-services. The protocols involve the encryption of data and messages with symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, the digital signing of messages, the authentication of users, the establishment of secure tunnels, and the use of secure hashing and salting. The goal is to ensure that, if a malicious person attempts to intercept the headers or payload of a cloud-based mobile app, they will be unable to access valuable information.

## Cryptographic Protocols Mechanisms Examples: 

| Security Requirement | Mobile Platform | Mechanism | Description | OSI Layer |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Authentication | iOS | OAuth | OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol for allowing access to a protected resource | Application layer |
| Encryption | Android | TLS | Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communications over a computer network | Transport Layer |
| Integrity | iOS | SHA-1 | Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) is a cryptographic hash function used to generate a 160-bit hash value | Application layer |
| Non-repudiation | Android | HMAC | HMAC is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the integrity of a message by using a secret key | Application layer |

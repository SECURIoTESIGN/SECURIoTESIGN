# ID-based Authentication Mechanisms 

ID-based authentication mechanisms are used to authenticate users in cloud-based mobile applications. This type of authentication typically involves the use of an identifier such as an email address or phone number, as well as a password or some other form of proof of identity. ID-based authentication may also involve the use of biometric markers like fingerprints or facial recognition to verify the user's identity. By using ID-based authentication, mobile applications can ensure that only authorized users are granted access, thereby protecting the data stored and exchanged on the application.

# Node Tampering Attack 

Node tampering is a type of malicious activity that involves using administrator-level access to modify the configuration of a node within a distributed system in order to gain an advantageous or illegal position. It can be used to bring down a network, access confidential data, or bypass security protocols. Node tampering can also be used to alter the functioning of a node or to access privileged resources on the node. 

By tampering with a node, attackers may gain access to the node's resources or disrupt the node's functioning, resulting in a network outage or data leakage. Node tampering can also be used for malicious purposes, such as gaining access to a node's confidential resources or records. 

## Mitigation

1. Physical Security: Implement physical security measures to protect IoT devices from tampering. This could include secure device enclosures or tamper-evident seals;
2. Secure Boot: Use secure boot mechanisms to ensure that the IoT device only boots up with software that is trusted by the manufacturer;
3. Device Authentication: Each IoT device should have a unique identity and should authenticate itself before it can join the network;
4. Data Encryption: Encrypt data at rest and in transit. This can prevent a malicious node from intercepting and tampering with the data;
5. Regular Firmware Updates: Regularly update the firmware of IoT devices. Firmware updates often include patches for known security vulnerabilities;
6. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Implement IDS in the cloud to monitor network traffic and detect any suspicious activities that could indicate a tampering attack.

# Meltdown Attack 

Meltdown is a security vulnerability in modern processors that can allow malicious applications to access higher privileged memory. It exploits a processor's speculative execution feature to gain access to memory locations that should otherwise be inaccessible. This vulnerability has the potential to expose sensitive information, such as passwords, from the memory of other processes running on the same system.

## Mitigation

1. **Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI):** Implement KPTI to separate user space and kernel space memory. This can prevent unauthorized access to kernel memory;
2. **Regular Updates and Patches:** Keep your systems and software up-to-date. Regular updates and patches can fix known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by Meltdown;
3. **Microcode Updates:** Apply microcode updates provided by the CPU manufacturer. These updates can provide additional protections against Meltdown;
3. **Disable Hyper-Threading:** If possible, disable hyper-threading on the CPU. This can reduce the potential attack surface for Meltdown;
4. **Use of Virtualization:** Use virtualization technologies that provide strong isolation between virtual machines. This can limit the impact of a Meltdown attack on a single virtual machine;
5. **Monitoring and Auditing:** Implement monitoring and auditing of system activities. This can help detect any unusual or suspicious behavior that could indicate a Meltdown attack.

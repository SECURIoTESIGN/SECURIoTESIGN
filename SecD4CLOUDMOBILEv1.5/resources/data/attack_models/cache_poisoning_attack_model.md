# Cache Poisoning Attacks

In this type of attack the attacker uses DNS to convert the domain name to an IP address for the purpose of accessing the user's confidential data. On the other hand, sender and a receiver get rerouted through some evil connection.

## Definition

Cache poisoning is the act of introducing false information into a Domain Name System (DNS) cache in order to cause DNS queries to return an incorrect response and, e.g., redirect users to malicious websites. This type of attack can target the cache of an application (e.g., a web browser cache) or a public cache (e.g. a DNS or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache), exposing the application to a variety of attacks, such as redirection to malicious websites and malware injection.

## Mitigation

Cache poisoning is a type of cyber attack where false information is introduced into a cache, causing systems to return incorrect responses. Here are some strategies to mitigate Cache Poisoning in Cloud, Mobile, and IoT ecosystems:

1. **Data Validation**: Implement strict data validation to ensure that only legitimate data is stored in the cache.

2. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and audit your systems to detect any unusual activities or potential security breaches.

3. **Use of Secure Cloud Services**: Use secure cloud services for IoT devices. These services provide a spectrum of capabilities, including data storage, data processing, and application hosting, which can help IoT devices collect, analyze, and share data securely.

4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the cloud or transmitting it over the network.

5. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can access the cache.

6. **Security by Design**: Secure application development across these three technologies can only be achieved when applications and systems are designed and developed with security in mind. This will improve the quality of the solutions and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified.

7. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use IDS to monitor your systems and generate alerts when suspicious activities are detected.

Remember, the key to effective mitigation is a proactive approach to security. Regularly updating security measures and staying informed about the latest threats can go a long way in protecting your systems from Cache Poisoning and other cyber threats.

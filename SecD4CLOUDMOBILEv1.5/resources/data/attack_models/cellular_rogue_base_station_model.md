# Cellular Rogue Base Station Attacks

In this attack scenario, the attacker uses his own fake equipment, imitating a legitimate cellular base station. Since cellular devices connect to whichever station has the strongest signal, the attacker can easily convince a targeted cellular device to talk to the rogue base station.

## Definition

 Cellular Rogue Base Station is a security threat targeting a mobile phone network that can exploit the radio interface between smartphones and base stations, potentially launching passive or active attacks against user equipment. Such attacks range from acquiring the International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) of subscribers, DoS, leaking private information on 4G networks and eavesdropping.

## Mitigation

1. **Use of Encrypted Communication**: Encourage the use of encrypted communication apps that do not rely solely on the security of cellular networks. This can prevent an attacker from intercepting the data even if they manage to create a rogue base station.

2. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring solutions to detect unusual network activities. This can help in identifying potential rogue base stations.

3. **Security Patches and Updates**: Keep all software, including operating systems and applications, up to date. This helps to patch any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

4. **User Awareness**: Educate users about the risks of connecting to unknown networks and the importance of using secure and encrypted communication channels.

5. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use firewalls and IDS to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

6. **Secure Cloud Configurations**: Ensure that your cloud configurations are secure and that all data is encrypted during transmission.

7. **IoT Security Measures**: Implement IoT-specific security measures such as device authentication, secure booting, and hardware-based security solutions.

Remember, security is a continuous process and it's important to stay updated with the latest threats and mitigation strategies.

# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Logging 

## Security Best Practices for Logging
### Introduction
Logging is a critical component of operational security, which can be used to detect potential security incidents, verify compliance with internal and external regulatory requirements, and provide an audit trail for later forensic activities. Proper logging configurations and practice can help you protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your system, as well as reduce the chances of data privacy breaches.

This guide provides an overview of some of the best practices for configuring, maintaining, and viewing logs.

### Logging Practices 

1. Establish a logging policy: Decide which logs need to be saved and how long the logs need to be retained, and share the policy with stakeholders.

2. Set up log aggregation and storage: Ensure that access and storage controls are configured on log files to protect the log data from manipulation or unauthorized access.

3. Choose appropriate log retention periods and awareness programs: Decide how long the logs should be retained before disposal.

4. Utilize log monitoring and analysis tool: Use a tool to automate the collection, analysis, and alerting on log data.

5. Configure the system to generate detailed logs: Detail the events required to capture in the logs including, but not limited to, user authentication, attempted logins, system startup/shutdown, system modifications, etc.

6. Encrypt data in transit and at rest: Ensure data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

7. Test logging regularly: Test the logging system regularly to ensure that all relevant data is being logged as desired.

8. Ensure only authorized users can view the logs: Apply role-based access control and passwords to prevent unauthorized access to log data.

9. Educate users on logging: Inform users about logging best practices and policies to avoid inadvertent violations.

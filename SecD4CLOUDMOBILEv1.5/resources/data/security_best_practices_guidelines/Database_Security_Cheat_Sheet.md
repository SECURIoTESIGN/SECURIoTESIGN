# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Database Security 

## Database Security Best Practices

### 1. Establish Separation of Duties 

To help reduce the potential for fraud or unauthorized access, establish a separation of duties between those responsible for administering the database, those responsible for defining security policies, and those able to access the data. 

### 2. Encrypt Data in Transit and at Rest

Where possible, use encryption techniques for data stored in the database and for data while it is in transit. This helps protect the data from malicious activity.

### 3. Restrict Database Access

Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the database. Implement security measures such as user authentication, user profiles, role-based access control, two-factor authentication, etc.

### 4. Regularly Monitor Database Activity

Regularly monitor database activity and user access. Monitor authentication activities, login attempts, data modification requests, etc. Review logs regularly and ensure that access requests are authorized.

### 5. Update Databases Regularly

Databases can quickly become outdated and insecure. Make sure to regularly patch, update, and upgrade the database and applications running on it.

### 6. Regularly Test Database Security

Regularly test the security of the database to identify potential vulnerabilities. Also, test the strength of passwords and other security controls.

### 7. Implement An Active Database Backup Strategy 

To minimize disruption in the event of a data breach or other security incident, maintain an active and testable database backup strategy.

### 8. Use Intrusion-Prevention Systems

Implement intrusion-prevention systems to monitor and protect the database from malicious activity.

# Security Best Practices for Authentication 

Authentication is an important part of the security of any system. Here are best practices that should be followed to ensure a secure authentication process:

- Use strong passwords. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and should include both upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
- Use multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This requires users to provide additional forms of authentication, such as a one-time code sent to a phone or email.
- Use a security question to protect accounts. This should be a question that is difficult for outsiders to answer but easy for the user to remember.
- Require users to change their password regularly. This helps reduce the risk of stolen credentials.
- Don’t allow the same password to be used again after expiration or change.
- Limit log-in attempts. If too many invalid attempts are made, lock the account. 
- Implement a lockout policy. After a certain number of failed attempts, lock the account and require the user to reset the password.
- Monitor user log-ins and suspicious activity.
- Don’t store passwords in plain text. All passwords should be encrypted.
- Use security protocols such as TLS or SSL.
- Keep authentication systems up-to-date with the latest patches and security fixes. 
- Ensure that all staff are properly trained on authentication best practices.

The property that ensures that information is not disclosed or made available to any unauthorized entity. In other words, information cannot be accessed by an unauthorized third party.

**Note:** *This requirement is applied were the information is stored.*

Failure to guarantee this security requirement can lead to the leakage or loss of confidential data shared among authorized users of the application e a aplicação poderá estar sujeita aos seguintes ataques:

### 1. Brute Force 
The attacker attempts to gain access to systems' asset (information, functionality, identity, etc.) protected by a finite secret value by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset.
### 2. Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping is a type of attack where the attacker tries to gain access to sensitive information of legitimate users from the messages (text, voice and video) exchanged between two or more users of Instant Messaging (IM) applications. The same applies to recorded calls, call logs and multimedia stored in clear text on memory cards.

# Accountability

The property that ensures that every action can be traced back to a single user or device.  

**Note:** *This requirement is applied over Internet transactions.*  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:

### 1. DNS Attacks 
                                                               
DNS attacks always occur in the case where the attacker makes use of the translation of the domain name in an Internet Protocol (IP) address, in order to access the confidential data of the user in an unauthorized way. 

### 2. MITM Attacks
                                                 
In this type of attack, an attacker attempts to intrude on a mail exchange or continuous message between two users or clients of a cloud-based mobile application (client-server).   

### 3. VM Escape

This type of attack occurs whenever an application escapes the VM and obtains control over the VMM, as it escalates its VM privileges to root level. The malicious application accesses the host machine, bypassing the hypervisor.

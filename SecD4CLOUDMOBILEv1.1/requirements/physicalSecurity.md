It also results in other types of attacks aimed at accessing, altering or destroying sensitive user information or making a service or resource unavailable. 

### 2. Physical Theft 

This type of attack aims to access and steal the target user's device in order to perform a malicious action, such as altering, deleting, leaking, inserting and destroying data, as well as stealing money through banking transactions, posing as the rightful owner.

# Non-Repudiation

The security property that ensures that the transfer of messages or credentials between 2 mobile users entities is undeniable . 

**Note:** *This requirement is applied between information transactions, between information transactions over the Internet in the Cloud and in the database.*  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:            

### 1. VM Escape

This type of attack occurs whenever an application escapes the VM and obtains control over the VMM, as it escalates its VM privileges to root level. The malicious application accesses the host machine, bypassing the hypervisor.  

### 2. Mobile SIM Swapping

This attack targets the SIM card of a smartphone user, i.e. swapping the victim user's SIM card. SIM swapping can happen remotely. A cybercriminal, with a few important details about your life in hand, can answer security questions correctly, impersonate you, and convince your mobile carrier to reassign your phone number to a new SIM card. At that point, the criminal can get access to your phoneâ€™s data and start changing your account passwords to lock you out of your online banking profile, email, and more.

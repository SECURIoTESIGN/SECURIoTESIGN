# DoS (Cellular) Jamming Attacks

This type of attack aims to dominate and disrupt communication between a user's mobile device and the cell tower by actively transmitting signals.

## Definition

 Interference attacks target radio communication technology (communication between smart devices and base stations). This attack can be caused by noise, interference, disruption or by sending corrupted data packets, with the purpose of causing DoS in the physical transmission of signals on certain routes. 
 
## Technical Impact

 * Resource Consumption.

## Typical Severity

 * Low.

## Risk Analysis

 * High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

 * Low.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the DoS Jamming attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

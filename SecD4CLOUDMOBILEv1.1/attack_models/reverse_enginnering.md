# Reverse Engineering Attacks

Typically, this attack consists of using specific tools to analyze the target application (feature or resources), within its own local environment, downloaded from a mobile application store, such as Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, respectively.



## Definition

Reverse engineering attacks (REA) target the assets embedded in software. In such an attack scenario, the attacker by reverse engineering attempts to steal confidential information, such as embedded cryptographic keys or intellectual property in the form of algorithms. There are two ways of carrying out this type of attack:

 * White Box Reverse Engineering;
 * Black Box Reverse Engineering.
 
## Technical Impact
* Reveal information about back end servers;
* Reveal cryptographic constants and ciphers;
* Steal intellectual property;
* Perform attacks against back end systems;
* Gain intelligence needed to perform subsequent code modification.

## Risk Analysis
  * High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit
  * Low.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Reverse Engineering attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

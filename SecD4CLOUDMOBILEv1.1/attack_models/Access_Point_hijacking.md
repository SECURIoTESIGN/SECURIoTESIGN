# Access Point Hijacking Attacks

In a scenario of this type of attack, which targets the wireless network, the attacker aims to take control of the wireless network by hijacking the access point (administration hijacking). 

## Definition

 This type of attack is a variant of the session hijacking attack and targets the AP access credentials of legitimate administrators. These credentials can be extracted through a sniffing, brute force or MiTM attack. After this, the attacker is able to carry out other types of attacks, such as DoS and Rogue Access Point.

 
## Technical Impact

* Read Data;
* Modify Data;
* Gain Privileges;
* Bypass Protection Mechanism;
* Denial of service.

## Typical Severity

* Very High.

## Risk Analysis

* High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

* High.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Access Point Hijacking attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

# Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing and BlueSmacking Attacks

These are DDoS-type attacks that target a Bluetooth wireless network in order to shut down activity on it. It usually occurs through an attack coming from a connection of malicious entities in a target network.

## Definition

 Bluejacking occurs by sending unsolicited messages between the mobile devices (host nodes) over the Bluetooth connection. The unauthorized information can be accessed from a mobile device through Bluesnarfing to Bluetooth enabled devices using  OBject EXchange (OBEX) protocol. Through the Bluejacking attack, attackers can send unwanted sounds, videos to other Bluetooth enabled devices. Bluesnarfing attack consists of using Bluetooth connection for the purpose of stealing sensitive information (contacts, emails, passwords, photos, and other useful data) from wireless devices such as smartphones, tablets and IoT. In a Bluesmacking cenario attack, an adversary uses Bluetooth flooding to transfer large packets to Bluetooth enabled devices over the L2CAP protocol with the goal of creating a DoS.

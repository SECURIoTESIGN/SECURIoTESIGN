# Cellular Rogue Base Station Attacks

In this attack scenario, the attacker uses his own fake equipment, imitating a legitimate cellular base station. Since cellular devices connect to whichever station has the strongest signal, the attacker can easily convince a targeted cellular device to talk to the rogue base station.

## Definition

 Cellular Rogue Base Station is a security threat targeting a mobile phone network that can exploit the radio interface between smartphones and base stations, potentially launching passive or active attacks against user equipment. Such attacks range from acquiring the International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) of subscribers, DoS, leaking private information on 4G networks and eavesdropping.
 
## Technical Impact

* Read Data;
* Denial of service.

## Typical Severity

* Low.

## Risk Analysis

  * Medium Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

  * Medium.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Cellular Rogue Base Station attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

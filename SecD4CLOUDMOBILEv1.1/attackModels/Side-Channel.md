# Side-Channel Attacks

It is a type of attack enabled by leakage of information from a physical cryptosystem.


## Definition

Side-channel attacks use statistical models such as differential analysis and correlation analysis on the information leaked from the cryptographic device during runtime. While early attacks required attackers to be in physical possession of the device, newer side-channel attacks such as cache-timing attacks or DRAM row buffer attacks are conducted remotely by executing malicious software in the targeted cloud environment. Regarding smartphones/tablets, they have developed more sophisticated side-channel attacks that target the built-in sensors of these devices, allowing them to infer keyboard input on touchscreens through sensor readings of native applications and websites, infer a user's location by the power consumption available in the proc file system (procfs), and infer a user's identity, location and diseases through procfs.

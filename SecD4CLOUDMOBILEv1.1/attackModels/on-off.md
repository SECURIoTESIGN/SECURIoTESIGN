# On-Off Attacks

This is a clever attack, from which one can try to disrupt a trust redemption scheme by alternately behaving well and badly, so that trust is always redeemed immediately before another attack occurs. An On-off attack can associate with a selective forwarding attack where it mostly forwards all packets, but occasionally drops most or all packets.

## Definition

 This type of attack targets a wireless sensor network (WSN), aiming to disrupt a trust redemption scheme, behaving alternately good and bad, in order to ensure immediate trust redemption before another attack occurs. An On-off attack in association with another type of attack, e.g., a malicious node in a WSN may associate a selective forwarding attack with the On-off attack where it mostly forwards all packets but occasionally drops most or all packets. 

 
## Technical Impact

* Read Data.

## Risk Analysis

  * High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit

  * Medium.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the On-Off attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

# Cryptanalysis Attacks

This attack consists in deciphering a ciphered message without knowing the decryption key by exploiting vulnerabilities in the cryptographic algorithm.


## Definition

 Cryptanalysis focuses on finding vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms and using these weaknesses to decrypt the ciphertext without knowing the secret key. In addition, this can have other purposes such as Total Breach, Global Deduction, Information Deduction, and Distinguishing Algorithm.
 
## Technical Impact

* Read Data.

## Typical Severity

* Very High.

## Risk Analysis

* Very High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit
  
* Low.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Cryptanalysis Attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

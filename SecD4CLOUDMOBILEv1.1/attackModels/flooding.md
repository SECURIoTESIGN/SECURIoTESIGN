# Flooding or Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)  Attacks

Flooding is an enhanced Denial of Service (DoS) attack type, originating from multiple network attack surfaces that were previously compromised to disrupt the services or resources provided by the target server. It differs from DoS in that it generates more traffic, so that the targeted server cannot handle requests. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.

## Definition

The Flooding attack attempts to make a service unavailable to intended users by draining the system or network resource. Attackers can now launch various DDoS attacks, including resource-focused attacks (eg, network bandwidth, memory, and CPU) and app-focused attacks (e.g., mobile applications, database service) from almost every attack places. This type of attack can be executed as follows:

 * TCP Flood;
 * UDP Flood;
 * ICMP Flood;
 * HTTP Flood;
 * SSL Flood;
 * Amplification;
 * ML Flood;
 * BlueSmacking.

## Technical Impact

  * Crash, Exit, or Restart;
  * Bypass protection mechanism;
  * Other.

## Typical Severity

  * Medium.

## Risk

  * High.

## Likelihood of Exploit
  * High.
  
## Attacker's Powers

 * Make features and services unavailable to authorized users;
 * Perpetrate other types of attacks and even extract sensitive and critical data.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Flooding attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security tests present in the full report are followed.

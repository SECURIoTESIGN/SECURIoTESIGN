# Eavesdropping Attacks
Eavesdropping is a type of attack where the attacker tries to gain access to sensitive information 
of legitimate users from the messages (text, voice and video) exchanged between two or more users 
of Instant Messaging (IM) applications. The same applies to recorded calls, call logs and multimedia 
stored in clear text in memory cards.

## Description
An adversary intercepts a form of communication (e.g. text, audio, video) by way of software (e.g., microphone 
and audio recording application), hardware (e.g., recording equipment), or physical means (e.g., physical proximity). 
The goal of eavesdropping is typically to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about the target for 
financial, personal, political, or other gains. It entails listening in on the raw 
audio source of a conversation between two or more parties. This type of attack can be carried out in two different ways:
1. Shoulder Surfing (Physical Eavesdropping);
2. Probe Audio and Video Peripheralsn (Software Eavesdropping).

## Recommendations
In order to mitigate the espionage type attacks it is convenient to follow the good practice guidelines, aiming at incorporating
the security mechanisms during the coding and implementation phase and carrying out the security tests suggested and present in 
the report during the verification phase, with the purpose of ensuring that the functional requirements linked to security and 
the non-functional requirements of the application to be developed or deployed are met.

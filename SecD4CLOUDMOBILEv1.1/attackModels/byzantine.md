# Byzantine Attacks

In a Byzantine attack scenario, the attacker targets the routing protocols of an ad hoc wireless network, aiming to access and modify sensitive data exchanged between two or more entities on this network.

## Definition

 In a mobile ad hoc wireless network, Byzantine attacks are defined as attacks that target routing protocols, in which two or more routers collude to drop, fabricate, modify, or divert packets in an attempt to disrupt routing services.
 
## Technical Impact

* Read Data;
* Modify Data;
* Denial of service.

## Typical Severity

* High.

## Risk Analysis

* High Risk.

## Likelihood of Exploit
  
* Medium.

## Recommendations

In order to ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to the Byzantine Attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security testing present in the full report are followed.

<h1>Authentication</h1>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.</p>
<h2>Authentication General Guidelines</h2>
<h3>User IDs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your usernames/user IDs are case-insensitive (e.g. User 'smith' and user 'Smith' should be the same user); </li>
<li>Usernames should also be unique; </li>
<li>For high-security applications, usernames could be assigned and secret instead of user-defined public data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Authentication Solution and Sensitive Accounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> allow login with sensitive accounts (i.e. accounts that can be used internally within the solution such as to a back-end / middle-ware / DB) to any front-end user-interface</li>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use the same authentication solution (e.g. IDP / AD) used internally for unsecured access (e.g. public access / DMZ)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implement Proper Password Strength Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Password Length<ul>
<li>Minimum password length (10 characters) should be enforced;</li>
<li>Maximum password length should not be too short because it will prevent users from creating passphrases; </li>
<li>The typical maximum length is 128 characters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not silently truncate passwords.</li>
<li>Allow usage of <strong>all</strong> characters including unicode and whitespace.</li>
<li>Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, or at the time of compromise identification.</li>
<li>Include password strength meter to help users create a more complex password and block common and previously breached passwords<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn">zxcvbn-ts library</a> can be used for this purpose;</li>
<li><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">Pwned Passwords</a> is a service where passwords can be checked against previously breached passwords. You can host it yourself or use the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords">API</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implement Secure Password Recovery Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please check <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet.html">Forgot Password Cheat Sheet</a> for details on this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Store Passwords in a Secure Fashion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html">Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a> for details on this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compare Password Hashes Using Safe Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using a secure password comparison function provided by the language or framework, such as the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php">password_verify()</a> function in PHP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where this is not possible, ensure that the comparison function:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a maximum input length, to protect against denial of service attacks with very long inputs.</p>
</li>
<li>Explicitly sets the type of both variable, to protect against type confusion attacks such as <a href="https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/">Magic Hashes</a> in PHP.</li>
<li>Returns in constant time, to protect against timing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Change Password Feature</h3>
<p>When developing change password feature, ensure to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>User is authenticated with active session.</li>
<li>Current password verification.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transmit Passwords Only Over TLSv1.3 or Other Strong Transport</h3>
<p>Check: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html">Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet</a></p>
<h3>Require Re-authentication for Sensitive Features</h3>
<p>Require the current credentials for an account before updating sensitive account information such as the user's password, user's email, or before sensitive transactions, such as shipping a purchase to a new address to avoid CSRF or XSS;</p>
<h3>Consider Strong Transaction Authentication</h3>
<p>The application must use a second authentication factor in financial transactions.</p>
<h4>TLS Client Authentication</h4>
<p>It is a good idea to do this when:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is acceptable (or even preferred) that the user only has access to the website from only a single computer/browser;</li>
<li>The user is not easily scared by the process of installing TLS certificates on his browser, or there will be someone, probably from IT support, that will do this for the user;</li>
<li>The website requires an extra step of security;</li>
<li>It is also a good thing to use when the website is for an intranet of a company or organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is generally not a good idea to use this method for widely and publicly available websites that will have an average user (e.g. Facebook)</p>
<h3>Authentication and Error Messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incorrectly implemented error messages in the case of authentication functionality can be used for the purposes of user ID and password enumeration. </li>
<li>An application should respond (both HTTP and HTML) in a generic manner.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authentication Responses</h4>
<p>Using any of the authentication mechanisms (login, password reset or password recovery), an application must respond with a generic error message regardless of whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user ID or password was incorrect.</li>
<li>The account does not exist.</li>
<li>The account is locked or disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Incorrect and correct response examples</h5>
<h6>Login</h6>
<p>Incorrect response examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Login for User foo: invalid password."</li>
<li>"Login failed, invalid user ID."</li>
<li>"Login failed; account disabled."</li>
<li>"Login failed; this user is not active."</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct response example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Login failed; Invalid user ID or password."</li>
</ul>
<h6>Password recovery</h6>
<p>Incorrect response examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We just sent you a password reset link."</li>
<li>"This email address doesn't exist in our database."</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct response example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"If that email address is in our database, we will send you an email to reset your password."</li>
</ul>
<h6>Account creation</h6>
<p>Incorrect response examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This user ID is already in use."</li>
<li>"Welcome! You have signed up successfully."</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct response example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A link to activate your account has been emailed to the address provided."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Protect Against Automated Attacks</h3>
<p>Countermeasures against automated attacks on authentication stand out: </p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA);</li>
<li>Account Lockout;</li>
<li>CAPTCHA;</li>
<li>Security Questions and Memorable Words.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging and Monitoring</h2>
<p>Enable logging and monitoring of authentication functions to detect attacks/failures on a real-time basis</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all failures are logged and reviewed;</li>
<li>Ensure that all password failures are logged and reviewed;</li>
<li>Ensure that all account lockouts are logged and reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use of authentication protocols that require no password</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OAuth
  * Implement OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0 since the very first version (OAuth1.0) has been found to be vulnerable to session. fixation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenId;</p>
</li>
<li>SAML
  * Implement version 2.0 since it is very feature-complete and provides strong security. </li>
<li>FIDO.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Password Managers</h2>
<p>Web applications should not make password managers' job more difficult than necessary by observing the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use standard HTML forms for username and password input with appropriate <code>type</code> attributes.<ul>
<li>Avoid plugin-based login pages (such as Flash or Silverlight).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement a reasonable maximum password length, such as 64 characters, as discussed in the <a href="Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.md#maximum-password-lengths">Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a>.</li>
<li>Allow any printable characters to be used in passwords.</li>
<li>Allow users to paste into the username and password fields.</li>
<li>Allow users to navigate between the username and password field with a single press of the <code>Tab</code> key.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Multi-Factor Authentication</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Multi-Factor authentication (MFA), or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is when a user is required to present more than one type of evidence in order to authenticate on a system. There are four different types of evidence (or factors) that can be used, listed in the table below:</p>

<p>It should be emphasised that while requiring multiple examples of a single factor (such as needing both a password and a PIN) <strong>does not constitute MFA</strong>, although it may provide some security benefits over a simple password.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the following sections discuss the disadvantage and weaknesses of various different types of MFA, in many cases these are only relevant against targeted attacks. <strong>Any MFA is better than no MFA</strong>.</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>The most common way that user accounts get compromised on applications is through weak, re-used or stolen passwords. Despite any technical security controls implemented on the application, users are liable to choose weak passwords, or to use the same password on different applications. As developers or system administrators, it should be assumed that users' passwords will be compromised at some point, and the system should be designed in order to defend against this.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is by far the best defense against the majority of password-related attacks, including brute-force, <a href="Credential_Stuffing_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">credential stuffing</a> and password spraying, with analysis by Microsoft suggesting that it would have stopped <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Your-Pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">99.9% of account compromises</a>.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of MFA is the increase in management complexity for both administrators and end users. Many less technical users may find it difficult to configure and use MFA. Additionally, there are a number of other common issues encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of MFA that require users to have specific hardware can introduce significant costs and administrative overheads.</li>
<li>Users may become locked out of their accounts if they lose or are unable to use their other factors.</li>
<li>MFA introduces additional complexity into the application.</li>
<li>Many MFA solutions add external dependencies to systems, which can introduce security vulnerabilities or single points of failure.</li>
<li>Processes implemented to allow users to bypass or reset MFA may be exploitable by attackers.</li>
<li>Requiring MFA may prevent some users from accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quick Recommendations</h2>
<p>Exactly when and how MFA is implemented in an application will vary on a number of different factors, including the threat model of the application, the technical level of the users, and the level of administrative control over the users. These need to be considered on a per-application basis.</p>
<p>However, the following recommendations are generally appropriate for most applications, and provide an initial starting point to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the option for users to enable MFA on their accounts using <a href="#software-totp-tokens">TOTP</a>.</li>
<li>Require MFA for administrative or other high privileged users.</li>
<li>Consider allowing corporate IP ranges so that MFA is not required from them.</li>
<li>Allow the user to remember the use of MFA in their browser, so they are not prompted every time they login.</li>
<li>Implement a secure process to allow users to reset their MFA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementing MFA</h2>
<h3>When to Require MFA</h3>
<p>The most important place to require MFA on an application is when the user logs in. However, depending on the functionality available, it may also be appropriate to require MFA for performing sensitive actions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing passwords or security questions.</li>
<li>Changing the email address associated with the account.</li>
<li>Disabling MFA.</li>
<li>Elevating a user session to an administrative session.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the application provides multiple ways for a user to authenticate these should all require MFA, or have other protections implemented. A common area that is missed is if the application provides a separate API that can be used to login, or has an associated mobile application.</p>
<h3>Improving Usability</h3>
<p>Having to frequently login with MFA creates an additional burden for users, and may cause them to disable MFA on the application. A number of mechanisms can be used to try and reduce the level of annoyance that MFA causes. However, these types of measures do decrease the security provided by MFA, so need to be risk assessed to find a reasonable balance of security and usability for the application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remembering the user's browser so they don't need to use MFA every time.<ul>
<li>This can either be permanent, or for a period of a few days.</li>
<li>This needs to be done with more than just a cookie, which could be stolen by an attacker.<ul>
<li>For example, a cookie matched to the previous IP address the cookie was issued for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow corporate IP ranges (or, more strictly, using location as a second factor).<ul>
<li>This doesn't protect against malicious insiders, or a user's workstation being compromised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only requiring MFA for sensitive actions, not for the initial login.<ul>
<li>This will depend heavily on the functionality in the application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Failed Login Attempts</h3>
<p>When a user enters their password, but fails to authenticate using a second factor, this could mean one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has lost their second factor, or doesn't have it available (for example, they don't have their mobile phone, or have no signal).</li>
<li>The user's password has been compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of steps that should be taken when this occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt the user to try another form of MFA<ul>
<li>For example, an SMS code rather than using their hardware OTP token.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow the user to attempt to <a href="#resetting-mfa">reset their MFA</a>.</li>
<li>Notify the user of the failed login attempt, and encourage them to change their password if they don't recognize it.<ul>
<li>The notification should include the time, browser and geographic location of the login attempt.</li>
<li>This should be displayed next time they login, and optionally emailed to them as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resetting MFA</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges with implementing MFA is handling users who forget or lose their second factors. There are many ways this could happen, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-installing a workstation without backing up digital certificates.</li>
<li>Wiping or losing a phone without backing up OTP codes.</li>
<li>Changing mobile numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to prevent users from being locked out of the application, there needs to be a mechanism for them to regain access to their account if they can't use their existing MFA; however it is also crucial that this doesn't provide an attacker with a way to bypass MFA and hijack their account.</p>
<p>There is no definitive "best way" to do this, and what is appropriate will vary hugely based on the security of the application, and also the level of control over the users. Solutions that work for a corporate application where all the staff know each other are unlikely to be feasible for a publicly available application with thousands of users all over the world. Every recovery method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and these need to be evaluated in the context of the application.</p>
<p>Some suggestions of possible methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing the user with a number of single-use recovery codes when they first setup MFA.</li>
<li>Requiring the user to setup multiple types of MFA (such as a digital certificate, OTP core and phone number for SMS), so that they are unlikely to lose access to all of them at once.</li>
<li>Posting a one-use recovery code (or new hardware token) to the user.</li>
<li>Requiring the user contact the support team and having a rigorous process in place to verify their identity.</li>
<li>Requiring another trusted user to vouch for them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Something You Know</h2>
<p>The most common type of authentication is based on something the users knows - typically a password. The biggest advantage of this factor is that it has very low requirements for both the developers and the end user, as it does not require any special hardware, or integration with other services.</p>
<h3>Passwords and PINs</h3>
<p>Passwords and PINs are the most common form of authentication due to the simplicity of implementing them. The <a href="Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#implement-proper-password-strength-controls">Authentication Cheat Sheet</a> has guidance on how to implement a strong password policy, and the <a href="Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.md">Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a> has guidance on how to securely store passwords.</p>
<p>Most multi-factor authentication systems make use of a password, as well as at least one other factor.</p>
<p>It should be noted that PINs, "secret words" and other similar type of information are all effectively the same as passwords. Using two different types of passwords <strong>does not constitute MFA</strong>.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Simple and well understood.</li>
<li>Native support in every authentication framework.</li>
<li>Easy to implement.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users are prone to choosing weak passwords.</li>
<li>Passwords are commonly re-used between systems.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Questions</h3>
<p>Security questions require the user to choose (or create) a number of questions that only they will know the answer to. These are effectively the same as passwords, although they are generally considered weaker. The <a href="Choosing_and_Using_Security_Questions_Cheat_Sheet.md">Choosing and Using Security Questions Cheat Sheet</a> contains further guidance on how to implement these securely.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Simple and well understood.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Questions often have easily guessable answers.</li>
<li>Answers to questions can often be obtained from social media or other sources.</li>
<li>Questions must be carefully chosen so that users will remember answers years later.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Something You Have</h2>
<p>The second factor is something that the user possesses. This could be a physical item (such as a hardware token), a digital item (such as a certificate or private key), or based on the ownership of a mobile phone, phone number, or email address (such as SMS or a software token installed on the phone, or an email with a single-use verification code).</p>
<p>If properly implemented then this can be significantly more difficult for a remote attacker to compromise; however it also creates an additional administrative burden on the user, as they must keep the authentication factor with them whenever they wish to use it.</p>
<p>The requirement to have a second factor can also limit certain types of users' ability to access a service. For example, if a user does not have access to a mobile phone, many types of MFA will not be available for them.</p>
<h3>Hardware OTP Tokens</h3>
<p>Physical hardware OTP tokens can be used which generate constantly changing numeric codes, which must be submitted when authentication on the application. Most well-known of these is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_SecurID">RSA SecureID</a>, which generates a six digit number that changes every 60 seconds.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>As the tokens are separate physical devices, they are almost impossible for an attacker to compromise remotely.</li>
<li>Tokens can be used without requiring the user to have a mobile phone or other device.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deploying physical tokens to users is expensive and complicated.</li>
<li>If a user loses their token it could take a significant amount of time to purchase and ship them a new one.</li>
<li>Some implementations require a backend server, which can introduce new vulnerabilities as well as a single point of failure.</li>
<li>Stolen tokens can be used without a PIN or device unlock code.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing (although short-lived).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software TOTP Tokens</h3>
<p>A cheaper and easier alternative to hardware tokens is using software to generate Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) codes. This would typically involve the user installing a TOTP application on their mobile phone, and then scanning a QR code provided by the web application which provides the initial seed. The authenticator app then generates a six digit number every 60 seconds, in much the same way as a hardware token.</p>
<p>Most websites use standardized TOTP tokens, allowing the user to install any authenticator app that supports TOTP. However, a small number of applications use their own variants of this (such as Symantec), which requires the users to install a specific app in order to use the service. This should be avoided in favour of a standards-based approach.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The absence of physical tokens greatly reduces the cost and administrative overhead of implementing the system.</li>
<li>When users lose access to their TOTP app, a new one can be configured without needing to ship a physical token to them.</li>
<li>TOTP is widely used, and many users will already have at least one TOTP app installed.</li>
<li>As long as the user has a screen lock on their phone, an attacker will be unable to use the code if they steal the phone.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>TOTP apps are usually installed on mobile devices, which are vulnerable to compromise.</li>
<li>The TOTP app may be installed on the same mobile device (or workstation) that is used to authenticate.</li>
<li>Users may store the backup seeds insecurely.</li>
<li>Not all users have mobile devices to use with TOTP.</li>
<li>If the user's mobile device is lost, stolen or out of battery, they will be unable to authenticate.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing (although short-lived).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardware U2F Tokens</h3>
<p>Hardware U2F tokens communicate with the users workstation over USB or NFC, and implement challenge-response based authentication, rather than requiring the user to manually enter the code. This would typically be done by the user pressing a button on the token, or tapping it against their NFC reader.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Longer codes can be used, which may provide a higher level of security.</li>
<li>Users can simply press a button rather than typing in a code.</li>
<li>Resistant to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>As with hardware OTP tokens, the use of physical tokens introduces significant costs and administrative overheads.</li>
<li>Stolen tokens can be used without a PIN or device unlock code.</li>
<li>As the tokens are usually connected to the workstation via USB, users are more likely to forget them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certificates</h3>
<p>Digital certificates are files that are stored on the user's device which are automatically provided alongside the user's password when authenticating. The most common type is X.509 certificates (discussed in the <a href="Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.md#consider-the-use-of-client-side-certificates">Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet</a>), more commonly known as client certificates.</p>
<p>Certificates are supported by all major web browsers, and once installed require no further interaction from the user. The certificates should be linked to an individual's user account in order to prevent users from trying to authenticate against other accounts.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to purchase and manage hardware tokens.</li>
<li>Once installed, certificates are very simple for users.</li>
<li>Certificates can be centrally managed and revoked.</li>
<li>Resistant to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Using digital certificates requires backend PKI system.</li>
<li>Installing certificates can be difficult for users, particularly in a highly restricted environment.</li>
<li>Enterprise proxy servers which perform SSL decryption will prevent the use of certificates.</li>
<li>The certificates are stored on the user's workstation, and as such can be stolen if their system is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Smartcards</h3>
<p>Smartcards are credit-card size cards with a chip containing a digital certificate for the user, which is unlocked with a PIN. They are commonly used for operating system authentication, but are rarely used in web applications.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stolen smartcards cannot be used without the PIN.</li>
<li>Smartcards can be used across multiple applications and systems.</li>
<li>Resistant to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Managing and distributing smartcards has the same costs and overheads as hardware tokens.</li>
<li>Smartcards are not natively supported by modern browsers, so require third party software.</li>
<li>Although most business-class laptops have smartcard readers built in, home systems often do not.</li>
<li>The use of smartcards requires functioning backend PKI systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SMS Messages and Phone Calls</h3>
<p>SMS messages or phone calls can be used to provide users with a single-use code that they must submit as a second factor.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Relatively simple to implement.</li>
<li>Requires user to link their account to a mobile number.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires the user to have a mobile device or landline.</li>
<li>Require user to have signal to receive the call or message.</li>
<li>Calls and SMS messages may cost money to send (need to protect against attackers requesting a large number of messages to exhaust funds.</li>
<li>A number of attacks against SMS or mobile numbers have been demonstrated and exploited in the past.</li>
<li>SMS messages may be received on the same device the user is authenticating from.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Email verification requires that the user enters a code or clicks a link sent to their email address. There is some debate as to whether email constitutes a form of MFA, because if the user does not have MFA configured on their email account, it simply requires knowledge of the user's email password (which is often the same as their application password). However, it is included here for completeness.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to implement.</li>
<li>No requirements for separate hardware or a mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Relies entirely on the security of the email account, which often lacks MFA.</li>
<li>Email passwords are commonly the same as application passwords.</li>
<li>Provides no protection if the user's email is compromised first.</li>
<li>Email may be received by the same device the user is authenticating from.</li>
<li>Susceptible to phishing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Something You Are</h2>
<p>The final factor in the traditional view of MFA is something you are - which is one of the physical attributes of the users (often called biometrics). Biometrics are rarely used in web applications due to the requirement for users to have specific hardware.</p>
<h3>Biometrics</h3>
<p>The are a number of common types of biometrics that are used, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fingerprint scans</li>
<li>Facial recognition</li>
<li>Iris scans</li>
<li>Handprint scans</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Well-implemented biometrics are hard to spoof, and require a targeted attack.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Require manual enrolment of the user's physical attributes.</li>
<li>Custom (sometimes expensive) hardware is often required to read biometrics.</li>
<li>Modern browsers do not have native support, so custom client-side software is required.</li>
<li>Privacy concerns: Sensitive physical information must be stored about users.</li>
<li>If compromised, biometric data can be difficult to change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The use of location as a fourth factor for MFA is not fully accepted;  however, it is increasingly be used for authentication. It is sometimes argued that location is used when deciding whether or not to require MFA (as discussed <a href="#when-to-require-mfa">above</a>) however this is effectively the same as considering it to be a factor in its own right. Two prominent examples of this are the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access Policies</a> available in Microsoft Azure, and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-how-to-enable-network-unlock">Network Unlock</a> functionality in BitLocker.</p>
<p>When talking about location, access to the application that the user is authenticating against is not usually considered (as this would always be the case, and as such is relatively meaningless).</p>
<h3>Source IP Ranges</h3>
<p>The source IP address the user is connecting from can be used as a factor, typically in an allow-list based approach. This could either be based on a static list (such as corporate office ranges) or a dynamic list (such as previous IP addresses the user has authenticated from).</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very easy for users.</li>
<li>Requires minimal configuration and management from administrative staff.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't provide any protection if the user's system is compromised.</li>
<li>Doesn't provide any protection against rogue insiders.</li>
<li>Trusted IP addresses must be carefully restricted (for example, if the open guest Wi-Fi uses the main corporate IP range).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geolocation</h3>
<p>Rather than using the exact IP address of the user, the geographic location that the IP address is registered to can be used. This is less precise, but may be more feasible to implement in environments where IP addresses are not static. A common usage would be to require additional authentication factors when an authentication attempt is made from outside of the user's normal country.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very easy for users</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't provide any protection if the user's system is compromised.</li>
<li>Doesn't provide any protection against rogue insiders.</li>
<li>Easy for an attacker to bypass by obtaining IP addresses in the trusted country or location.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Authorization</h1>
<p>Authorization may be defined as "the process of verifying that a requested action or service is approved for a specific entity" (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/authorization">NIST</a>). Authorization is distinct from authentication which is the process of verifying an entity's identity. When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind. A user who has been authenticated (perhaps by providing a username and password) is often not authorized to access every resource and perform every action that is technically possible through a system. For example, a web app may have both regular users and admins, with the admins being able to perform actions the average user is not privileged to do so, even though they have been authenticated. Additionally, authentication is not always required for accessing resources; an unauthenticated user may be authorized to access certain public resources, such as an image or login page, or even an entire web app.</p>
<h2>Authorization Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Enforce Least Privileges</h3>
<p>Best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the design phase, ensure trust boundaries are defined. Enumerate the types of users that will be accessing the system, the resources exposed and the operations (such as read, write, update, etc) that might be performed on those resources. For every combination of user type and resource, determine what operations, if any, the user (based on role and/or other attributes) must be able to perform on that resource. For an ABAC system ensure all categories of attributes are considered. For example, a Sales Representative may need to access a customer database from the internal network during working hours, but not from home at midnight.</li>
<li>Create tests that validate that the permissions mapped out in the design phase are being correctly enforced.</li>
<li>After the app has been deployed, periodically review permissions in the system for "privilege creep"; that is, ensure the privileges of users in the current environment do not exceed those defined during the design phase (plus or minus any formally approved changes).</li>
<li>Remember, it is easier to grant users additional permissions rather than to take away some they previously enjoyed. Careful planning and implementation of Least Privileges early in the SDLC can help reduce the risk of needing to revoke permissions that are later deemed overly broad.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deny by Default</h3>
<p>Best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a "deny-by-default" mentality both during initial development and whenever new functionality or resources are exposed by the app. One should be able to explicitly justify why a specific permission was granted to a particular user or group rather than assuming access to be the default position.</li>
<li>Although some frameworks or libraries may themselves adopt a deny-by-default strategy, explicit configuration should be preferred over relying on framework or library defaults. The logic and defaults of third-party code may evolve over time, without the developer's full knowledge or understanding of the change's implications for a particular project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Validate the Permissions on Every Request</h3>
<p>Validating permissions correctly on just the majority of requests is insufficient. Use specific technologies to validate the permissions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/javax/servlet/Filter.html">Java/Jakarta EE Filters</a> including implementations in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.0/reference/html5/#servlet-security-filters">Spring Security</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/middleware/">Middleware in the Django Framework</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorization-filters">.NET Core Filters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/middleware">Middleware in the Laravel PHP Framework</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Thoroughly Review the Authorization Logic of Chosen Tools and Technologies, Implementing Custom Logic if Necessary</h3>
<p>Best Practices</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, maintain, and follow processes for detecting and responding to vulnerable components.</li>
<li>Incorporate tools such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/">Dependency Check</a> into the SDLC and consider subscribing to data feeds from vendors, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds">the NVD</a>, or other relevant sources.</li>
<li>
<p>Implement defense in depth. Do not depend on any single framework, library, technology, or control to be the sole thing enforcing proper access control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take time to thoroughly understand any technology you build authorization logic upon. Analyze the technologies capabilities with an understanding that <em>the authorization logic provided by the component may be insufficient for your application's specific security requirements</em>. Relying on prebuilt logic may be convenient, but this does not mean it is sufficient. Understand that custom authorization logic may well be necessary to meet an app's security requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>Do not let the capabilities of any library, platform, or framework guide your authorization requirements. Rather, authorization requirements should be decided first and then the third-party components may be analyzed in light of these requirements.</li>
<li>Do not rely on default configurations.</li>
<li>Test configuration. Do not just assume any configuration performed on a third-party component will work exactly as intended in your particular environment. Documentation can be misunderstood, vague, outdated, or simply inaccurate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prefer Attribute and Relationship Based Access Control over RBAC</h3>
<p>In software engineering, two basic forms of access control are widely utilized: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). There is a third, more recent, model which has gained popularity: Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC). The decision between the models has significant implications for the entire SDLC and should be made as early as possible.</p>
<p>Use ABAC and ReBAC access control for application development.</p>
<h3>Ensure Lookup IDs are Not Accessible Even When Guessed or Cannot Be Tampered With</h3>
<p>Applications often expose the internal object identifiers (such as an account number or Primary Key in a database) that are used to locate and reference an object. This ID may exposed as a query parameter, path variable, "hidden" form field or elsewhere. Recommended mitigations for this weakness include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid exposing identifiers to the user when possible. For example it should be possible to retrieve some objects, such as account details,  based solely on currently authenticated user's identity and attributes (e.g. through information contained in a securely implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) or server-side session).</li>
<li>Implement user/session specific indirect references using a tool such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/">OWASP ESAPI</a> (see <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References">OWASP 2013 Top 10 - A4 Insecure Direct Object References</a>)</li>
<li>Perform access control checks on <em>every</em> request for the <em>specific</em> object or functionality being accessed. Just because a user has access to an object of a particular type does not mean they should have access to every object of that particular type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enforce Authorization Checks on Static Resources</h3>
<p>Best Practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that static resources are incorporated into access control policies.</li>
<li>Ensure any cloud based services used to store static resources are secured using the configuration options and tools provided by the vendor.</li>
<li>When possible, protect static resources using the same access control logic and mechanisms that are used to secure other application resources and functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verify that Authorization Checks are Performed in the Right Location</h3>
<p>Best Practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers must never rely on client-side access control checks;</li>
<li>Access control checks must be performed server-side, at the gateway, or using serverless function (see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/ASVS/v4.0.3/4.0/OWASP%20Application%20Security%20Verification%20Standard%204.0.3-en.pdf">OWASP ASVS 4.0.3, V1.4.1 and V4.1.1</a>);</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exit Safely when Authorization Checks Fail</h3>
<p>Best Practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure all exception and failed access control checks are handled no matter how unlikely they seem (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/v3/en/c10-errors-exceptions.html">OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls C10: Handle all errors and exceptions</a>). This does not mean that an application should always try to "correct" for a failed check; oftentimes a simple message or HTTP status code is all that is required.</li>
<li>Centralize the logic for handling failed access control checks.</li>
<li>Verify the handling of exception and authorization failures. Ensure that such failures, no matter how unlikely, do not put the software into an unstable state that could lead to authorization bypass.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implement Appropriate Logging</h3>
<p>Best Practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log using consistent, well-defined formats that can be readily parsed for analysis.</li>
<li>Carefully determine the amount of information to log.</li>
<li>Ensure clocks and timezones are synchronized across systems. Accuracy is crucial in piecing together the sequence of an attack during and after incident response.</li>
<li>Consider incorporating application logs into a centralized log server or SIEM.</li>

<h1>Transaction Authorization</h1>
<h2>Purpose and audience</h2>
<p>The Purpose of this cheat sheet is to provide guidelines on how to securely implement transaction authorization to protect it from being bypassed. These guidelines can be used by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks</strong> - to define functional and non-functional requirements for transaction authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> – to design and implement transaction authorization without vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Pentesters</strong> – to test for transaction authorization security.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Some applications use a second factor to check whether an authorized user is performing sensitive operations. A common example is wire transfer authorization, typically used in online or mobile banking applications.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this document we will call that process: <em>transaction authorization</em>.</p>
<p>Usage scenarios are not only limited to financial systems. For example: an email with a secret code or a link with some kind of token to unlock a user account is also a special case of transaction authorization. A user authorizes the operation of account unlocking by using a second factor (a unique code sent to his email address). Transaction authorization can be implemented using various methods, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards with transaction authorization numbers (TAN),</li>
<li>Time based OTP tokens, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">OATH TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)</a>,</li>
<li>OTP sent by SMS or provided by phone</li>
<li>Digital signature using e.g. a smart card or a smart phone,</li>
<li>Challenge-response tokens, including unconnected card readers or solutions which scan transaction data from the user's computer screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these can be implemented on a physical device or in a mobile application.</p>
<p>Transaction authorization is implemented in order to protect for unauthorized wire transfers as a result of attacks using malware, phishing, password or session hijacking, CSRF, XSS, etc.. Unfortunately, as with any piece of code, this protection can be improperly implemented and as a result it might be possible to bypass this safeguard.</p>
<h2>1. Functional Guidelines</h2>
<h3>1.1 Transaction authorization method has to allow a user to identify and acknowledge significant transaction data</h3>
<p>User's computers cannot be trusted due to malware threats. Hence a method that prevents a user from identifying transaction on an external device cannot be considered as secure. Transaction data should be presented and acknowledged using an external authorization component.</p>
<p>Such transaction authorization components should be built using the <em>What You See Is What You Sign</em> principle. When a user authorizes a transaction they need to know what they are authorizing. Based on this principle, an authorization method must permit a user to identify and acknowledge the data that is significant to a given transaction. For example, in the case of a wire transfer: the target account and amount.</p>
<p>The decision about which transaction data can be considered as significant should be chosen based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real risk,</li>
<li>The technical capabilities and constraints of the chosen authorization method,</li>
<li>Positive user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example when an SMS message is used to send significant transaction data, it is possible to send the target account, amount and type of transfer. However, for an unconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Authentication_Program">CAP reader</a> it is perceived to be inconvenient for a user to enter these data. In such cases, entering only the most significant transaction data (e.g. partial target account number and amount) can be considered sufficient.</p>
<p>In general, significant transaction data should always be presented as an inherent part of the transaction authorization process. Whereas the user experience should be designed to encourage users to verify the transaction data.</p>
<p>If a transaction process requires a user to enter transaction data into an external device, the user should be prompted for providing specific value (e.g. a target account number). Entering a value without meaningful prompt could be easily abused by malware using social engineering techniques as described in the example in paragraph 1.4. Also, for more detailed discussion of input overloading problems, see <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/fc09optimised.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h3>1.2 Change of authorization token should be authorized using the current authorization token</h3>
<p>When a user is allowed to change authorization token by using the application interface, the operation should be authorized by using his current authorization credentials (as is the case with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Password_Change_or_Reset_Functionalities.html">password change procedure</a>). For example: when a user changes a phone number for SMS codes an authorization SMS code should be sent to the current phone number.</p>
<h3>1.3 Change of authorization method should be authorized using the current authorization method</h3>
<p>Some applications allow a user to chose between multiple methods of transaction authorization. In such cases, the user should authorize the change in authorization method using his current authorization method. Otherwise, malware may change the authorization method to the most vulnerable method.</p>
<p>Additionally, the application should inform the user about the potential dangers associated to the selected authorization method.</p>
<h3>1.4 Users should be able to easily distinguish the authentication process from the transaction authorization process</h3>
<p>Malware can trick users in authorizing fraudulent operations, when an application requires a user to perform the same actions for authentication as for transaction authorization. Consider the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application is using the same method for user authentication (usually as a second factor to traditional login/password) and for transaction authorization. E.g. by using a OTP token, Challenge-response codes, operation signing using external smartcard, ...</li>
<li>A malware may present the user a false error message after the first step (authentication to the application) and trick the user into repeating the authentication procedure. The first authentication code will be used by the malware for authentication, whereas the second code would be used to authorize a fraudulent transaction. Even challenge-response schemes could be abused using this scenario as malware can present a challenge taken from a fraudulent transaction and trick the user to provide response. Such an attack scenario is used widely in <a href="http://securityintelligence.com/back-basics-malware-authors-downgrade-tactics-stay-radar/#.VX_qI_krLDc">malware attacks against electronic banking</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the abovementioned scenario, the same method was used to authenticate the user and to authorize the transaction. Malware can abuse this behavior to extract transaction authorization credentials without the user's knowledge. Social engineering methods <a href="http://securityintelligence.com/tatanga-attack-exposes-chiptan-weaknesses/#.VZAy9PkrLDc">can be used despite utilized authentication and operation authorization methods</a> but the application shouldn't simplify such attack scenarios.</p>
<p>Safeguards should allow the user to easily distinguish authentication from transaction authorization. This could be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using different methods to authenticate and to authorize,</li>
<li>Or using different actions in an external security component (e.g. different mode of operation in CAP reader),</li>
<li>Or presenting the user a clear message about what they are "signing" (What You See Is What You Sign Principle).</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5 Each transaction should be authorized using unique authorization credentials</h3>
<p>Some applications are asking for transaction authorization credentials only once, e.g. static password, code sent through SMS, token response. Afterwards a user is able to authorize any transaction during the whole user's session or at least they have to reuse the same credentials each time they need to authorize a transaction. Such behavior is not sufficient to prevent malware attacks because malware will sniff such credentials and use them to authorize any transaction without the user's knowledge.</p>
<h2>2. Non-functional guidelines</h2>
<h3>2.1 Authorization should be performed and enforced server-side</h3>
<p>As for <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html">all other security controls</a> transaction authorization should be enforced server-side. By no means it should be possible to influence the authorization result by altering data which flows from a client to a server, e.g. by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tampering with parameters that contain transaction data,</li>
<li>Adding/removing parameters which will disable authorization check,</li>
<li>Causing an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, security programming best practices should be applied, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Positive_security_model">Default deny</a>.</li>
<li>Avoiding debugging functionality in production code.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid tampering, additional safeguards should be considered. For example by cryptographically protecting the data for confidentiality and integrity and while decrypting and verifying the data server side.</p>
<h3>2.2 Authorization method should be enforced server side</h3>
<p>When multiple transaction authorization methods are available to the user. The server should enforce the use of the current authorization method chosen by the user in the application settings or enforced by application policies. It should be impossible to change an authorization method by manipulating the parameters provided from the client. Otherwise, malware can downgrade an authorization method to a less or even the least secure authorization method.</p>
<p>This is especially important when an application is developed to add a new, more secure authorization method. It is not very rare,that a new authorization method is built on top of an old codebase. As a result, when a client is sending parameters using the old method, the transaction may be authorized, despite the fact that the user has already switched to a new method.</p>
<h3>2.3 Transaction verification data should be generated server-side</h3>
<p>When significant transaction data are transmitted programmatically to an authorization component, extra care should be put into denying client modifications on the transaction data at authorization. Significant transaction data that has to be verified by the user, should be generated and stored on a server, then passed to an authorization component without any possibility of tampering by the client.</p>
<p>A common anti pattern is to collect significant transaction data client-side and pass it to the server. In such cases, malware can manipulate these data and as a result, show faked transaction data in an authorization component.</p>
<h3>2.4 Application should prevent authorization credentials brute-forcing</h3>
<p>When transaction authorization credentials are sent to the server for verification, an application has to prevent brute-forcing. The transaction authorization process must be restarted after number of failed authorization attempts. In addition other anti brute-forcing and anti-automation techniques should be considered to prevent an attacker from automating his attacks,see <a href="Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#prevent-brute-force-attacks">OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<h3>2.5 Application should control which transaction state transitions are allowed</h3>
<p>Transaction authorization is usually performed in multiple steps, e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user enters the transaction data.</li>
<li>The user requests authorization.</li>
<li>The application initializes an authorization mechanism.</li>
<li>The user verifies/confirms the transaction data.</li>
<li>The user responds with the authorization credentials.</li>
<li>The application validates authorization and executes a transaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>An application should process such business logic flow in sequential step order and preventing a user from performing these steps out of order or in even skipping any of these steps (see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/">OWASP ASVS</a> requirement <strong>15.1</strong>).</p>
<p>This should protect against attack techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overwriting transaction data before user will enter the authorization credentials,</li>
<li>Skipping transaction authorization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6 Transaction data should be protected against modification</h3>
<p>The transaction authorization process should protect against attack scenarios that modify transaction data after the initial entry by the user. For example, a bad implementation of a transaction authorization process may allow the following attacks (for reference, see steps of transaction authorization described in paragraph 2.5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaying step 1 (sending transaction data) in the background and overwriting transaction details with fraudulent transaction, before the user enters authorization credentials.</li>
<li>Adding parameters with transaction data to a HTTP request which authorizes the transaction. In such a case, poor implementation will authorize the initial transaction and then execute a fraudulent transaction (specific example of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html">Time of Check to Time of Use vulnerability</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The protection against modification could be implemented using various techniques depending on the framework used, but one or more of the following should be present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any modification of transaction data should trigger invalidation of any previously entered authorization data. E.g. Generated OTP or challenge is invalidated.</li>
<li>Any modification of transaction data should trigger reset of the authorization process.</li>
<li>Any attempts to modify transaction data after the initial entry by the user is a symptom of tinkering with an application and should be logged, monitored and carefully investigated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7 Confidentiality of the transaction data should be protected during any client / server communications</h3>
<p>The transaction authorization process should protect the privacy of transaction data being presented to the user to authorize i.e. at section 2.5, steps 2 and 4.</p>
<h3>2.8 When a transaction is executed, the system should check whether it was authorized</h3>
<p>The result of the transaction entry and the authorization process described in paragraph 2.5 is the transaction execution. Just before the transaction is executed there should be a final control gate which verifies whether the transaction was properly authorized by the user. Such control, tied to execution, should prevent attacks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTOU) – example in paragraph 2.6</li>
<li>Skipping authorization check in the transaction entry process (see. paragraph 2.5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.9 Authorization credentials should be valid only by limited period of time</h3>
<p>In some malware attacks scenarios, authorization credentials entered by the user is passed to malware command and control server (C&amp;C) and then used from an attacker-controlled machine. Such a process is often performed manually by an attacker. To make such attacks difficult, the server should allow authorizing the transaction only in a limited time window between generating of challenge or OTP and the transaction authorization. Additionally, such safeguard will also aid in preventing resource exhaustion attacks. The time window should be carefully selected to not disrupt normal users' behavior.</p>
<h3>2.10 Authorization credentials should be unique for every operation</h3>
<p>To prevent all sorts of replay attacks, authorization credentials should be unique for every operation. It could be achieved using different methods depending on the applied transaction authorization mechanism. For example: using a timestamp, a sequence number or a random value in signed transaction data or as a part of a challenge.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>We identify other issues that should be taken into consideration while implementing transaction authorization. However we deem to be beyond the scope of this cheat sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which transactions should be authorized? All transactions or only some of them. Each application is different and an application owner should decide if all transactions should be authorized or only some of them, considering risk analysis, risk exposition of given application, and other safeguards implemented in an application.</li>
<li>We recommend the use of cryptographic operations to protect transactions and to ensure integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation.</li>
<li>Device enrolment or "pairing" of an external authorization device (or a mobile application) with the user account.</li>

<h1>Cross Site Scripting Prevention</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a misnomer. The name originated from early versions of the attack where stealing data cross-site was the primary focus. Since then, it has extended to include injection of basically any content, but we still refer to this as XSS. XSS is serious and can  lead to account impersonation, observing user behaviour, loading external content, stealing sensitive data, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Using the right combination of defensive techniques is necessary to prevent XSS.</strong></p>
<h2>Framework Security</h2>
<p>Developers need to be aware of problems that can occur when using frameworks insecurely such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>escape hatches</em> that frameworks use to directly manipulate the DOM;</li>
<li>React’s <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> without sanitising the HTML;</li>
<li>React cannot handle <code>javascript:</code> or <code>data:</code> URLs without specialized validation;</li>
<li>Angular’s <code>bypassSecurityTrustAs*</code> functions;</li>
<li>Template injection;</li>
<li>Out of date framework plugins or components;</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>XSS Defense Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frameworks make it easy to ensure variables are correctly validated and escaped or sanitised;</li>
<li>Use of Output Encoding and HTML Sanitization to address security gaps that exist in popular frameworks like React and Angular.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Encoding</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start with using your framework’s default output encoding protection when you wish to display data as the user typed it in;</li>
<li>If you’re not using a framework or need to cover gaps in the framework then you should use an output encoding library; </li>
<li>Each variable used in the user interface should be passed through an output encoding function.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different output encoding methods because browsers parse HTML, JS, URLs, and CSS differently. Using the wrong encoding method may introduce weaknesses or harm the functionality of your application.</p>
<p>Best practices to Output Encoding:
 * Output Encoding for “HTML Contexts”;
 * Output Encoding for “HTML Attribute Contexts”;
 * Output Encoding for “JavaScript Contexts”;
 * Output Encoding for “CSS Contexts”;
 * Output Encoding for “URL Contexts”
  * Common Mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dangerous Contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callback functions</p>
</li>
<li>Where URLs are handled in code such as this CSS { background-url : “javascript:alert(xss)”; }</li>
<li>All JavaScript event handlers (<code>onclick()</code>, <code>onerror()</code>, <code>onmouseover()</code>).</li>
<li>Unsafe JS functions like <code>eval()</code>, <code>setInterval()</code>, <code>setTimeout()</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML Sanitization</h2>
<p>Best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you sanitize content and then modify it afterwards, you can easily void your security efforts.</li>
<li>If you sanitize content and then send it to a library for use, check that it doesn’t mutate that string somehow. Otherwise, again, your security efforts are void.</li>
<li>You must regularly patch DOMPurify or other HTML Sanitization libraries that you use. Browsers change functionality and bypasses are being discovered regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Safe Sinks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to refactor your code to remove references to unsafe sinks like innerHTML, and instead use textContent or value;</li>
<li>Check <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Safe HTML Attributes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Controls</h2>
<p>OWASP recommends in all circumstances to implement against XSS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework Security Protections;</li>
<li>Output Encoding;</li>
<li>HTML Sanitization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider adopting the following controls in addition to the above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookie Attributes - These change how JavaScript and browsers can interact with cookies. Cookie attributes try to limit the impact of an XSS attack but don’t prevent the execution of malicious content or address the root cause of the vulnerability.</li>
<li>Content Security Policy - An allowlist that prevents content being loaded. It’s easy to make mistakes with the implementation so it should not be your primary defense mechanism. Use a CSP as an additional layer of defense and have a look at the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html">cheatsheet here</a>.</li>
<li>Web Application Firewalls - These look for known attack strings and block them. WAF’s are unreliable and new bypass techniques are being discovered regularly. WAFs also don’t address the root cause of an XSS vulnerability. In addition, WAFs also miss a class of XSS vulnerabilities that operate exclusively client-side. WAFs are not recommended for preventing XSS, especially DOM-Based XSS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Encoding Rules Summary</h3>
<p>The purpose of output encoding (as it relates to Cross Site Scripting) is to convert untrusted input into a safe form where the input is displayed as <strong>data</strong> to the user without executing as <strong>code</strong> in the browser. The following charts details a list of critical output encoding methods needed to stop Cross Site Scripting.</p>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Except for alphanumeric characters, encode all characters with the <code>\uXXXX</code> unicode encoding format (<strong>X</strong> = Integer).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CSS Hex Encoding</td>
<td>CSS encoding supports <code>\XX</code> and <code>\XXXXXX</code>. Using a two character encode can  cause problems if the next character continues the encode sequence.  There are two solutions: (a) Add a space after the CSS encode (will be  ignored by the CSS parser) (b) use the full amount of CSS encoding  possible by zero padding the value.</td>

<h1>Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. A CSRF attack works because browser requests automatically include all cookies including session cookies. Therefore, if the user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between legitimate authorized requests and forged authenticated requests. This attack is thwarted when proper Authorization is used, which implies that a challenge-response mechanism is required that verifies the identity and authority of the requester.</p>
<p>In short, the following principles should be followed to defend against CSRF:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check if your framework has <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-built-in-or-existing-csrf-implementations-for-csrf-protection">built-in CSRF protection</a> and use it</strong><ul>
<li><strong>If framework does not have built-in CSRF protection add <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#token-based-mitigation">CSRF tokens</a> to all state changing requests (requests that cause actions on the site) and validate them on backend</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For stateful software use the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern">synchronizer token pattern</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>For stateless software use <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">double submit cookies</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement at least one mitigation from <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#defense-in-depth-techniques">Defense in Depth Mitigations</a> section</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Consider <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#samesite-cookie-attribute">SameSite Cookie Attribute</a> for session cookies</strong> but be careful to NOT set a cookie specifically for a domain as that would introduce a security vulnerability that all subdomains of that domain share the cookie. This is particularly an issue when a subdomain has a CNAME to domains not in your control.</li>
<li><strong>Consider implementing <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#user-interaction-based-csrf-defense">user interaction based protection</a> for highly sensitive operations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-of-custom-request-headers">use of custom request headers</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#verifying-origin-with-standard-headers">verifying the origin with standard headers</a></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Remember that any Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can be used to defeat all CSRF mitigation techniques!</strong><ul>
<li><strong>See the OWASP <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet</a> for detailed guidance on how to prevent XSS flaws.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do not use GET requests for state changing operations.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>If for any reason you do it, protect those resources against CSRF</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Cryptographic Storage</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>These guidelines provide a simple model to follow when implementing solutions to protect data at rest.</p>
<p>Passwords should not be stored using reversible encryption - secure password hashing algorithms should be used instead.</p>
<h2>Architectural Design</h2>
<p>The first step in designing any application is to consider the overall architecture of the system, as this will have a huge impact on the technical implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Considering the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html">threat model</a> of the application (i.e, who you trying to protect that data against);</li>
<li>Use of dedicated secret or key management systems </li>
<li>Making the management of secrets significantly easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where to Perform Encryption</h3>
<p>Encryption can be performed on a number of levels in the application stack, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the application level;</li>
<li>At the database level (e.g, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL Server TDE</a>);</li>
<li>At the filesystem level (e.g, BitLocker or LUKS);</li>
<li>At the hardware level (e.g, encrypted RAID cards or SSDs).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimise the Storage of Sensitive Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wherever possible, the storage of sensitive information should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>For symmetric encryption <strong>AES</strong> with a key that's at least <strong>128 bits</strong> (ideally <strong>256 bits</strong>) and a secure <a href="#cipher-modes">mode</a> should be used as the preferred algorithm;</li>
<li>For asymmetric encryption, use elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) with a secure curve such as <strong>Curve25519</strong> as a preferred algorithm; </li>
<li>If ECC is not available and  <strong>RSA</strong> must be used, then ensure that the key is at least <strong>2048 bits</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an other many other symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, a number of factors should be taken into account, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key size.</li>
<li>Known attacks and weaknesses of the algorithm;</li>
<li>Maturity of the algorithm;</li>
<li>Approval by third parties such as <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program">NIST's algorithmic validation program</a>;</li>
<li>Performance (both for encryption and decryption);</li>
<li>Quality of the libraries available.</li>
<li>Portability of the algorithm (i.e, how widely supported is it);</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases there may be regulatory requirements that limit the algorithms that can be used, such as <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/140/2/final/documents/fips1402annexa.pdf">FIPS 140-2</a> or <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary#Strong%20Cryptography">PCI DSS</a>.</p>
<h3>Custom Algorithms</h3>
<p>Don't do this.</p>
<h3>Cipher Modes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GCM</strong> and <strong>CCM</strong>, cipher modes should be used as a first preference;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If GCM or CCM are not available, then CTR mode or CBC mode should be used in combination with separate authentication, such as using the Encrypt-then-MAC technique;</p>
</li>
<li>If random access to the encrypted data is required then XTS mode should be used. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Random Padding</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For RSA, it is essential to enable Random Padding also known as OAEP or Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Padding Schema of PKCS#1 is typically used in this case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Random Number Generation</h3>
<p>The table below shows the recommended algorithms for each language, as well as insecure functions that should not be used.</p>

<h3>Defence in Depth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applications should be designed to still be secure even if cryptographic controls fail;</li>
<li>Application should also not rely on the security of encrypted URL parameters, and should enforce strong access control to prevent unauthorised access to information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Management</h2>
<h3>Processes</h3>
<p>Formal processes should be implemented (and tested) to cover all aspects of key management, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating and storing new keys;</li>
<li>Distributing keys to the required parties;</li>
<li>Deploying keys to application servers;</li>
<li>Rotating and decommissioning old keys.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Generation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keys should be randomly generated using a cryptographically secure function;</li>
<li>Keys <strong>should not</strong> be based on common words or phrases, or on "random" characters generated by mashing the keyboard;</li>
<li>Where multiple keys are used (such as data separate data-encrypting and key-encrypting keys), they should be fully independent from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Lifetimes and Rotation</h3>
<p>Encryption keys should be changed (or rotated) based on a number of different criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the previous key is known (or suspected) to have been compromised.<ul>
<li>This could also be caused by a someone who had access to the key leaving the organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a specified period of time has elapsed (known as the cryptoperiod).<ul>
<li>There are many factors that could affect what an appropriate cryptoperiod is, including the size of the key, the sensitivity of the data, and the threat model of the system. See section 5.3 of <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf">NIST SP 800-57</a> for further guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the key has been used to encrypt a specific amount of data.<ul>
<li>This would typically be <code>2^35</code> bytes (~34GB) for 64-bit keys and <code>2^68</code> bytes (~295 exabytes) for 128-bit block size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is a significant change to the security provided by the algorithm (such as a new attack being announced).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once one of these criteria have been met, a new key should be generated and used for encrypting any new data. There are two main approaches for how existing data that was encrypted with the old key(s) should be handled:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decrypting it and re-encrypting it with the new key.</li>
<li>Marking each item with the ID of the key that was used to encrypt it, and storing multiple keys to allow the old data to be decrypted.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option should generally be preferred, as it greatly simplifies both the application code and key management processes; however, it may not always be feasible. Note that old keys should generally be stored for a certain period after they have been retired, in case old backups of copies of the data need to be decrypted.</p>
<p>It is important that the code and processes required to rotate a key are in place <strong>before</strong> they are required, so that keys can be quickly rotated in the event of a compromise. Additionally, processes should also be implemented to allow the encryption algorithm or library to be changed, in case a new vulnerability is found in the algorithm or implementation.</p>
<h2>Key Storage</h2>
<p>Securely storing cryptographic keys is one of the hardest problems to solve, as the application always needs to have some level of access to the keys in order to decrypt the data. While it may not be possible to fully protect the keys from an attacker who has fully compromised the application, a number of steps can be taken to make it harder for them to obtain the keys.</p>
<p>Where available, the secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system, framework or cloud service provider should be used. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical Hardware Security Module (HSM).</li>
<li>A virtual HSM.</li>
<li>Key vaults such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon KMS</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>.</li>
<li>Secure storage APIs provided by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.protecteddata?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8">ProtectedData</a> class in the .NET framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many advantages to using these types of secure storage over simply putting keys in configuration files. The specifics of these will vary depending on the solution used, but they include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central management of keys, especially in containerised environments.</li>
<li>Easy key rotation and replacement.</li>
<li>Secure key generation.</li>
<li>Simplifying compliance with regulatory standards such as FIPS 140 or PCI DSS.</li>
<li>Making it harder for an attacker to export or steal keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases none of these will be available, such as in a shared hosting environment, meaning that it is not possible to obtain a high degree of protection for any encryption keys. However, the following basic rules can still be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not hard-code keys into the application source code.</li>
<li>Do not check keys into version control systems.</li>
<li>Protect the configuration files containing the keys with restrictive permissions.</li>
<li>Avoid storing keys in environment variables, as these can be accidentally exposed through functions such as <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php">phpinfo()</a> or through the <code>/proc/self/environ</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Separation of Keys and Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where possible, encryption keys should be stored in a separate location from encrypted data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Encrypting Stored Keys</h3>
<p>Where possible, encryption keys should themselves be stored in an encrypted form. At least two separate keys are required for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Data Encryption Key (DEK) is used to encrypt the data.</li>
<li>The Key Encryption Key (KEK) is used to encrypt the DEK.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this to be effective, the KEK must be stored separately from the DEK. The encrypted DEK can be stored with the data, but will only be usable if an attacker is able to also obtain the KEK, which is stored on another system.</p>
<p>The KEK should also be at least as strong as the DEK. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption">envelope encryption</a> guidance from Google contains further details on how to manage DEKs and KEKs.</p>
<p>In simpler application architectures (such as shared hosting environments) where the KEK and DEK cannot be stored separately, there is limited value to this approach, as an attacker is likely to be able to obtain both of the keys at the same time. However, it can provide an additional barrier to unskilled attackers.</p>
<p>A key derivation function (KDF) could be used to generate a KEK from user-supplied input (such a passphrase), which would then be used to encrypt a randomly generated DEK. This allows the KEK to be easily changed (when the user changes their passphrase), without needing to re-encrypt the data (as the DEK remains the same).</p>

<h1>Database Security</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guides provides guidance on securely configuring and using the SQL and NoSQL databases. It is intended to be used by application developers when they are responsible for managing the databases, in the absence of a dedicated database administrator (DBA).</p>
<h2>Connecting to the Database</h2>
<p>The backend database used by the application should be isolated as much as possible, in order to prevent malicious or undesirable users from being able to connect to it. Exactly how this is achieved will depend on the system and network architecture. The following options could be used to protect it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling network (TCP) access and requiring all access is over a local socket file or named pipe.</li>
<li>Configuring the database to only bind on localhost.</li>
<li>Restricting access to the network port to specific hosts with firewall rules.</li>
<li>Placing the database server in a separate DMZ isolated from the application server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar protection should be implemented to protect any web-based management tools used with the database, such as phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>When an application is running on an untrusted system (such as a thick-client), it should always connect to the backend through an API that can enforce appropriate access control and restrictions. Direct connections should <strong>never</strong> be made from a thick client to the backend database.</p>
<h3>Transport Layer Protection</h3>
<p>The following steps should be taken to prevent unencrypted traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure the database to only allow encrypted connections.</li>
<li>Install a trusted digital certificate on the server.</li>
<li>Configure the client application to connect using TLSv1.2+ with modern ciphers (e.g, AES-GCM or ChaCha20).</li>
<li>Configure the client application to verify that the digital certificate is correct.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>The database should be configured to always require authentication, including connections from the local server. Database accounts should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protected with strong and unique passwords.</li>
<li>Used by a single application or service.</li>
<li>Configured with the minimum permissions required as discussed in the <a href="#permissions">permissions section below</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any system that has its own user accounts, the usual account management processes should be followed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular reviews of the accounts to ensure that they are still required.</li>
<li>Regular reviews of permissions.</li>
<li>Removing user accounts when an application is decommissioned.</li>
<li>Changing the passwords when staff leave, or there is reason to believe that they may have been compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Microsoft SQL Server, consider the use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/authentication-in-sql-server">Windows or Integrated-Authentication</a>, which uses existing Windows accounts rather than SQL Server accounts. This also removes the requirement to store credentials in the application, as it will connect using the credentials of the Windows user it is running under. The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-programming-authentication-windows-native.html">Windows Native Authentication Plugins</a> provides similar functionality for MySQL.</p>
<h3>Storing Database Credentials</h3>
<p>Database credentials should never be stored in the application source code, especially if they are unencrypted. Instead, they should be stored in a configuration file that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is outside of the webroot.</li>
<li>Has appropriate permissions so that it can only be read by the required user(s).</li>
<li>Is not checked into source code repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where possible, these credentials should also be encrypted or otherwise protected using built-in functionality, such as the <code>web.config</code> encryption available in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-strings-and-configuration-files#encrypting-configuration-file-sections-using-protected-configuration">ASP.NET</a>.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>The permissions assigned to database user accounts should be based on the principle of least privilege (i.e, the accounts should only have the minimal permissions required for the application to function). This can be applied at a number of increasingly granular levels depending on the functionality available in the database. The following steps should be applicable to all environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use the built-in <code>root</code>, <code>sa</code> or <code>SYS</code> accounts.</li>
<li>Do not grant the account administrative rights over the database instance.</li>
<li>Only allow the account to connect from allowed hosts.<ul>
<li>This would often be <code>localhost</code> or the address of the application server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only grant the account access to the specific databases it needs.<ul>
<li>Development, UAT and Production environments should all use separate databases and accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only grant the required permissions on the databases.<ul>
<li>Most applications would only need <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> permissions.</li>
<li>The account should not be the owner of the database as this can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid using database links or linked servers.<ul>
<li>Where they are required, use an account that has been granted access to only the minimum databases, tables, and system privileges required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more security-critical applications, it is possible to apply permissions at more granular levels, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table-level permissions.</li>
<li>Column-level permissions.</li>
<li>Row-level permissions</li>
<li>Blocking access to the underlying tables, and requiring all access through restricted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)">views</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Database Configuration and Hardening</h2>
<p>The database application should also be properly configured and hardened. The following principles should apply to any database application and platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install any required security updates and patches.</li>
<li>Configure the database services to run under a low privileged user account.</li>
<li>Remove any default accounts and databases.</li>
<li>Store <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log">transaction logs</a> on a separate disk to the main database files.</li>
<li>Configure a regular backup of the database.<ul>
<li>Ensure that the backups are protected with appropriate permissions, and ideally encrypted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Microsoft SQL Server</h3>
<ul>
<li>Disable <code>xp_cmdshell</code>, <code>xp_dirtree</code> and other stored procedures that are not required.</li>
<li>Disable Common Language Runtime (CLR) execution.</li>
<li>Disable the SQL Browser service.</li>
<li>Disable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode?view=sql-server-ver15">Mixed Mode Authentication</a> unless it is required.</li>
<li>Ensure that the sample <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases">Northwind and AdventureWorks databases</a> have been removed.</li>
<li>See Microsoft's articles on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/securing-sql-server">securing SQL Server</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MySQL and MariaDB</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run the <code>mysql_secure_installation</code> script to remove the default databases and accounts.</li>
<li>Disable the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file">FILE</a> privilege for all users to prevent them reading or writing files.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/security-guidelines.html">Oracle MySQL</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/securing-mariadb/">MariaDB</a> hardening guides.</li>

<h1>Denial of Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guides is focused on providing an overall, common overview with an informative, straight to the point guidance to propose angles on how to battle denial of service (DoS) attacks on different layers. It is by no means complete, however, it should serve as an indicator to inform the reader and to introduce a workable methodology to tackle this issue.</p>
<h2>Application attacks</h2>
<p>Application layer attacks focus on rendering applications unavailable by exhausting resources or by making it unusable in a functional way. These attacks do not have to consume the network bandwidth to be effective. Rather they place an operational strain on the application server in such a way that the server becomes unavailable, unusable or non-functional. All attacks exploiting weaknesses on OSI layer 7 protocol stack are generally categorised as application attacks. They are most challenging to identify/mitigate.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> List all attacks per category. Because we cannot map remediations one on one with an attack vector, we will first need to list them before discussing the action points</p>
<p><strong>Slow HTTP</strong> is a DoS attack type where HTTP requests are send very slow and fragmented, one at a time. Until the HTTP request was fully delivered, the server will keep resources stalled while waiting for the missing incoming data. At one moment, the server will reach the maximum concurrent connection pool, resulting in a DoS. From an attacker's perspective, slow HTTP attacks are cheap to perform because they require minimal resources.</p>
<h3>Software Design Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cheap validation first</strong>: Validation that is cheap in resources should be considered first. More (CPU, memory and bandwidth) expensive validation should be performed afterward. The reason is obvious, we want to reduce impact on these resources as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Graceful Degradation</strong> is the ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system or application break. DoS caused by application termination is a widespread problem. Implementing a fault tolerant design enables a system or application to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails. Graceful degradation is a core concept to follow during application design phase, in order to limit impact of DoS.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent single point of failure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid highly CPU consuming operations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep Queues short</strong></li>
<li><strong>Handle Exceptions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Protect overflow and underflow</strong></li>
<li><strong>Threading</strong>: Avoid operations which must wait for completion of large tasks to proceed. Asynchronous operations</li>
<li>Identify resource intensive pages and plan ahead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit server side session time based on inactivity and a final timeout</strong>: (resource exhaustion) While sessions timeout is most of the time discussed in relation to session security and preventing session hijacking, it is also an important measure to prevent resource exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Limit session bound information storage:</strong> the less data is linked to a session, the less burden a user session has on webserver's performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Input validation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit file upload size and extensions</strong> (resource exhaustion) to prevent DoS on file space storage or other web application functions which will use the upload as input (e.g. image resizing, PDF creation, etc.)        - <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload">Checklist</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Limit total request size</strong> (resource exhaustion) to make it harder for resource consuming DoS attack to succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent input based resource allocation</strong> (resource exhaustion).</li>
<li><strong>Prevent input based function and threading interaction</strong> (resource exhaustion). User input could influence how many times a function needs to be executed, or how intensive the CPU consumption becomes. Depending on (unfiltered) user input for resource allocation could allow a DoS scenario through resource exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Input based puzzles</strong> like captchas or simple math problems are often used to 'protect' a web form. They serve a purpose to protect against functionality abuse. The classic example is a webform that will send out an email after posting the request. A captcha could then prevent the mailbox from getting flooded by a malicious attacker or spambot. Notice that this kind of technology will not help defend against DoS attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Access control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication as a means to expose functionality</strong></li>
<li><strong>User lockout</strong> is a scenario where an attacker can take advantage of the application security mechanisms to cause DoS by abusing the login failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network attacks</h2>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> (Develop text) Attacks where network bandwidth gets saturation. Volumetric in nature. Amplification techniques make these attacks effective.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> (list attacks) NTP amplification, DNS amplification, UDP flooding, TCP flooding</p>
<h3>Network Design Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preventing single point of failure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pooling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> is the concept that data is stored so future requests for that data can be served faster. The more data is served via caching, to more resilient the application becomes to bandwidth exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Static resources hosting on a different domain</strong> will reduce the number of http requests on the web application. Images and JavaScript are typical files that are loaded from a different domain.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Rate limiting</h3>
<p>Rate limiting is the process of controlling traffic rate from and to a server or component. It can be implemented on infrastructure as well as on an application level. Rate limiting can be based on (offending) IPs, on IP block lists, on geolocation, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define a minimum ingress data rate limit</strong>, and drop all connections below that rate. Note that if the rate limit is set too low, this could impact clients. Inspect the logs to establish a baseline of genuine traffic rate. (Protection against slow HTTP attacks)</li>
<li><strong>Define an absolute connection timeout</strong></li>
<li><strong>Define a maximum ingress data rate limit</strong>, and drop all connections above that rate.</li>
<li><strong>Define a total bandwidth size limit</strong> to prevent bandwidth exhaustion</li>
<li><strong>Define a load limit</strong>, which specifies the number of users allowed to access any given resource at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ISP-Level remediations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter invalid sender addresses using edge routers</strong>, in accordance with RFC 2267, to filter out IP-spoofing attacks done with the goal of bypassing block lists.</li>
<li><strong>Check your ISP services in terms of DDOS beforehand</strong> (support for multiple internet access points, enough bandwidth (xx-xxx Gbit/s) and special hardware for traffic analysis and defence on application level</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global-Level remediations: Commercial cloud filter services</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider using a filter service in order to resist larger attacks (up to 500GBit/s)</li>
<li><strong>Filter services</strong> support different mechanics to filter out malicious or non compliant traffic</li>
<li><strong>Comply with relevant data protection/privacy laws</strong> - a lot of providers route traffic through USA/UK</li>
</ul>

<h1>File Upload</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>File uploading is one of the most important mechanisms in any application, be it web, hybrid mobile, or native. This mechanism ensures that the user is able to upload his photo, his cv, video, etc.</p>
<h2>Good Practices</h2>
<p>To ensure that secure file uploading, the following principles should be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>List allowed extensions. Only allow safe and critical extensions for business functionality<ul>
<li>Ensure that <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html">input validation</a> is applied before validating the extensions;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validate the file type, don't trust the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type">Content-Type header</a> as it can be spoofed;</li>
<li>Change the filename to something generated by the application;</li>
<li>Set a filename length limit. Restrict the allowed characters if possible;</li>
<li>Set a file size limit;</li>
<li>Only allow authorized users to upload files;</li>
<li>Store the files on a different server. If that's not possible, store them outside of the webroot<ul>
<li>In the case of public access to the files, use a handler that gets mapped to filenames inside the application (someid -&gt; file.ext).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the file through an antivirus or a sandbox if available to validate that it doesn't contain malicious data;</li>
<li>Ensure that any libraries used are securely configured and kept up to date;</li>
<li>Protect the file upload from <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">CSRF</a> attacks.</li>

</ul>
<h1>HTML5 Security</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following is a guidelines for implementing HTML 5 in a secure fashion.</p>
<h2>Communication APIs</h2>
<h3>Web Messaging</h3>
<p>Web Messaging (also known as Cross Domain Messaging) provides a means of messaging between documents from different origins in a way that is generally safer than the multiple hacks used in the past to accomplish this task. </p>
<p>However, there are still some recommendations to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>When posting a message, explicitly state the expected origin as the second argument to <code>postMessage</code> rather than <code>*</code> in order to prevent sending the message to an unknown origin after a redirect or some other means of the target window's origin changing;</li>
<li>The receiving page should <strong>always</strong>:<ul>
<li>Check the <code>origin</code> attribute of the sender to verify the data is originating from the expected location;</li>
<li>Perform input validation on the <code>data</code> attribute of the event to ensure that it's in the desired format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't assume you have control over the <code>data</code> attribute;</li>
<li>Both pages should only interpret the exchanged messages as <strong>data</strong>. Never evaluate passed messages as code (e.g. via <code>eval()</code>) or insert it to a page DOM (e.g. via <code>innerHTML</code>), as that would create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability;</li>
<li>To assign the data value to an element, instead of using a insecure method like <code>element.innerHTML=data;</code>, use the safer option: <code>element.textContent=data;</code></li>
<li>Check the origin properly exactly to match the FQDN(s) you expect. Note that the following code: <code>if(message.origin.indexOf(".owasp.org")!=-1) { /* ... */ }</code> is very insecure and will not have the desired behavior as <code>owasp.org.attacker.com</code> will match.</li>
<li>If you need to embed external content/untrusted gadgets and allow user-controlled scripts (which is highly discouraged), please check the information on <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#sandboxed-frames">sandboxed frames</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Validate URLs passed to <code>XMLHttpRequest.open</code>. Current browsers allow these URLs to be cross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extra attention to absolute URLs;</li>
<li>Ensure that URLs responding with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> do not include any sensitive content or information that might aid attacker in further attacks. Use the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header only on chosen URLs that need to be accessed cross-domain. Don't use the header for the whole domain;</li>
<li>Allow only selected, trusted domains in the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. Prefer allowing specific domains over blocking or allowing any domain (do not use <code>*</code> wildcard nor blindly return the <code>Origin</code> header content without any checks);</li>
<li>Keep in mind that CORS does not prevent the requested data from going to an unauthorized location. It's still important for the server to perform usual CSRF prevention;</li>
<li>While the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol">Fetch Standard</a> recommends a pre-flight request with the <code>OPTIONS</code> verb, current implementations might not perform this request, so it's important that "ordinary" (<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>) requests perform any access control necessary;</li>
<li>Discard requests received over plain HTTP with HTTPS origins to prevent mixed content bugs;</li>
<li>Don't rely only on the Origin header for Access Control checks. Browser always sends this header in CORS requests, but may be spoofed outside the browser. Application-level protocols should be used to protect sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WebSockets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drop backward compatibility in implemented client/servers and use only protocol versions above hybi-00. Popular Hixie-76 version (hiby-00) and older are outdated and insecure;</li>
<li>The recommended version supported in latest versions of all current browsers is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a> (supported by Firefox 11+, Chrome 16+, Safari 6, Opera 12.50, and IE10);</li>
<li>While it's relatively easy to tunnel TCP services through WebSockets (e.g. VNC, FTP), doing so enables access to these tunneled services for the in-browser attacker in case of a Cross Site Scripting attack. These services might also be called directly from a malicious page or program;</li>
<li>The protocol doesn't handle authorization and/or authentication. Application-level protocols should handle that separately in case sensitive data is being transferred;</li>
<li>Process the messages received by the websocket as data. Don't try to assign it directly to the DOM nor evaluate as code. If the response is JSON, never use the insecure <code>eval()</code> function; use the safe option JSON.parse() instead;</li>
<li>Only <code>wss://</code> (WebSockets over SSL/TLS) should be used for protection against Man-In-The-Middle attacks;</li>
<li>Always validate input coming from the remote site, as it might have been altered;</li>
<li>When implementing servers, check the <code>Origin:</code> header in the Websockets handshake. Though it might be spoofed outside a browser, browsers always add the Origin of the page that initiated the Websockets connection;</li>
<li>Always validate data coming through a WebSockets connection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Server-Sent Events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Validate URLs passed to the <code>EventSource</code> constructor, even though only same-origin URLs are allowed;</li>
<li>As mentioned before, process the messages (<code>event.data</code>) as data and never evaluate the content as HTML or script code;</li>
<li>Always check the origin attribute of the message (<code>event.origin</code>) to ensure the message is coming from a trusted domain. Use an allow-list approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage APIs</h2>
<h3>Local Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid storing any sensitive information in local storage where authentication would be assumed;</li>
<li>Due to the browser's security guarantees it is appropriate to use local storage where access to the data is not assuming authentication or authorization;</li>
<li>Use the object sessionStorage instead of localStorage if persistent storage is not needed. sessionStorage object is available only to that window/tab until the window is closed;</li>
<li>It's recommended not to store sensitive information in local storage to avoid a sigle Cross Site Scripting;</li>
<li>A single <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting</a> can be used to load malicious data into these objects too, so don't consider objects in these to be trusted;</li>
<li>Pay extra attention to "localStorage.getItem" and "setItem" calls implemented in HTML5 page. It helps in detecting when developers build solutions that put sensitive information in local storage, which can be a severe risk if authentication or authorization to that data is incorrectly assumed;</li>
<li>Do not store session identifiers in local storage as the data is always accessible by JavaScript. Cookies can mitigate this risk using the <code>httpOnly</code> flag;</li>
<li>Avoid hosting multiple applications on the same origin, all of them would share the same localStorage object, use different subdomains instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Client-side databases</h3>
<ul>
<li>On November 2010, the W3C announced Web SQL Database (relational SQL database) as a deprecated specification. A new standard Indexed Database API or IndexedDB (formerly WebSimpleDB) is actively developed, which provides key-value database storage and methods for performing advanced queries;</li>
<li>It's recommended not to store any sensitive information in local storage;</li>
<li>If utilized, WebDatabase content on the client side can be vulnerable to SQL injection and needs to have proper validation and parameterization;</li>
<li>Don't store any sensitive information in web database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geolocation</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using the Geolocation API, for privacy reasons, it's recommended to require user input before calling <code>getCurrentPosition</code> or <code>watchPosition</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Workers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure code in all Web Workers scripts is not malevolent;</li>
<li>Don't allow creating Web Worker scripts from user supplied input;</li>
<li>Validate messages exchanged with a Web Worker. Do not try to exchange snippets of JavaScript for evaluation e.g. via <code>eval()</code> as that could introduce a DOM Based XSS vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tabnabbing</h2>
<p>It's the capacity to act on parent page's content or location from a newly opened page via the back link exposed by the <strong>opener</strong> JavaScript object instance.</p>
<p>It applies to an HTML link or a JavaScript <code>window.open</code> function using the attribute/instruction <code>target</code> to specify a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp">target loading location</a> that does not replace the current location and then makes the current window/tab available.</p>
<p>To prevent this issue, the following actions are available:</p>
<p>Cut the back link between the parent and the child pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>For HTML links:<ul>
<li>To cut this back link, add the attribute <code>rel="noopener"</code> on the tag used to create the link from the parent page to the child page. This attribute value cuts the link, but depending on the browser, lets referrer information be present in the request to the child page;</li>
<li>To also remove the referrer information use this attribute value: <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the JavaScript <code>window.open</code> function, add the values <code>noopener,noreferrer</code> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open">windowFeatures</a> parameter of the <code>window.open</code> function;</li>
</ul>
<p>As the behavior using the elements above is different between the browsers, either use an HTML link or JavaScript to open a window (or tab), then use this configuration to maximize the cross supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>For HTML links, add the attribute <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> to every link;</li>
<li>For JavaScript, use this function to open a window (or tab):</li>
</ul>
<p><code>javascript
function openPopup(url, name, windowFeatures){
  //Open the popup and set the opener and referrer policy instruction
  var newWindow = window.open(url, name, 'noopener,noreferrer,' + windowFeatures);
  //Reset the opener link
  newWindow.opener = null;
}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Add the HTTP response header <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer</code> to every HTTP response sent by the application (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/">Header Referrer-Policy information</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compatibility matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=noopener">noopener</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=noreferrer">noreferrer</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=referrer-policy">referrer-policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sandboxed frames</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>sandbox</code> attribute of an <code>iframe</code> for untrusted content;</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>sandbox</code> attribute of an <code>iframe</code> enables restrictions on content within an <code>iframe</code>. The following restrictions are active when the <code>sandbox</code> attribute is set:</p>
<ol>
<li>All markup is treated as being from a unique origin;</li>
<li>All forms and scripts are disabled;</li>
<li>All links are prevented from targeting other browsing contexts;</li>
<li>All features that trigger automatically are blocked;</li>
<li>All plugins are disabled.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In old versions of user agents where this feature is not supported, this attribute will be ignored. Use this feature as an additional layer of protection or check if the browser supports sandboxed frames and only show the untrusted content if supported.</p>
</li>
<li>Apart from this attribute, to prevent Clickjacking attacks and unsolicited framing it is encouraged to use the header <code>X-Frame-Options</code> which supports the <code>deny</code> and <code>same-origin</code> values. Other solutions like framebusting <code>if(window!==window.top) { window.top.location=location;}</code> are not recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credential and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Input hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Protect the input values from being cached by the browser.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Access a financial account from a public computer. Even though one is logged-off, the next person who uses the machine can log-in because the browser autocomplete functionality. To mitigate this, we tell the input fields not to assist in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>html
&lt;input type="text" spellcheck="false" autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;</code></p>
<p>Text areas and input fields for PII (name, email, address, phone number) and login credentials (username, password) should be prevented from being stored in the browser. Use these HTML5 attributes to prevent the browser from storing PII from your form:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>spellcheck="false"</code>;</li>
<li><code>autocomplete="off"</code>;</li>
<li><code>autocorrect="off"</code>;</li>
<li><code>autocapitalize="off"</code>;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Offline Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Require user input before sending any <code>manifest</code> file.</li>
<li>Users should only cache trusted websites and clean the cache after browsing through open or insecure networks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Progressive Enhancements and Graceful Degradation Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>The best practice now is to determine the capabilities that a browser supports and augment with some type of substitute for capabilities that are not directly supported. This may mean an onion-like element, e.g. falling through to a Flash Player if the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is unsupported, or it may mean additional scripting code from various sources that should be code reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTTP Headers to enhance security</h2>
<p>Consult the project <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/">OWASP Secure Headers</a> in order to obtains the list of HTTP security headers that an application should use to enable defenses at browser level.</p>
<h2>WebSocket implementation hints</h2>
<p>In addition to the elements mentioned above, this is the list of areas for which caution must be taken during the implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access filtering through the "Origin" HTTP request header;</li>
<li>Input/Output validation;</li>
<li>Authentication;</li>
<li>Authorization;</li>
<li>Access token explicit invalidation;</li>
<li>Confidentiality and Integrity.</li>

<h1>Securing Cascading Style</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this <code>CSS</code> Cheat Sheet is to inform Programmers, Testers, Security Analysts, Front-End Developers and anyone who is interested in Web Application Security to use these recommendations or requirements in order to achieve better security when authoring <code>Cascading Style Sheets</code>.</p>
<p>Let's demonstrate this risk with an example:</p>
<p>Santhosh is a programmer who works for a company called <strong>X</strong> and authors a Cascading Style Sheet to implement styling of the web application. The application for which he is writing CSS Code has various roles like <strong>Student</strong>, <strong>Teacher</strong>, <strong>Super User</strong> &amp; <strong>Administrator</strong> and these roles have different permissions (PBAC - <a href="Access_Control_Cheat_Sheet.md">Permission Based Access Control</a>) and Roles (RBAC - <a href="Access_Control_Cheat_Sheet.md">Role Based Access Control</a>). Not only do these roles have different access controls, but these roles could also have different styling for webpages that might be specific to an individual or group of roles.</p>
<p>Santhosh thinks that it would a great optimized idea to create a "global styling" CSS file which has all the CSS styling/selectors for all of the roles. According to their role, a specific feature or user interface element will be rendered. For instance, Administrator will have different features compared to <strong>Student</strong> or <strong>Teacher</strong> or <strong>SuperUser</strong>. However, some permissions or features maybe common to some roles.</p>
<p>Example: Profile Settings will be applicable to all the users here while <em>Adding Users</em> or <em>Deleting Users</em> is only applicable for <strong>Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.login</code></li>
<li><code>.profileStudent</code></li>
<li><code>.changePassword</code></li>
<li><code>.addUsers</code></li>
<li><code>.deleteUsers</code></li>
<li><code>.addNewAdmin</code></li>
<li><code>.deleteAdmin</code></li>
<li><code>.exportUserData</code></li>
<li><code>.exportProfileData</code></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's examine what are the risks associated with this style of coding.</p>
<h3>Risk #1</h3>
<p>Motivated Attackers always take a look at <code>*.CSS</code> files to learn the features of the application even without being logged in.</p>
<p>For instance: Jim is a motivated attacker and always tries to look into CSS files from the View-Source even before other attacks. When Jim looks into the CSS file, they see that there are different features and different roles based on the CSS selectors like <code>.profileSettings,</code> <code>.editUser,</code> <code>.addUser,</code> <code>.deleteUser</code> and so on. Jim can use the CSS for intel gathering to help gain access to sensitive roles. This is a form of attacker due diligence even before trying to perform dangerous attacks to gain access to the web application.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, having global styling could reveal sensitive information that could be beneficial to the attacker.</p>
<h3>Risk #2</h3>
<p>Let's say, Santhosh has this habit of writing the descriptive selector names like <code>.profileSettings,</code> <code>exportUserData,</code> <code>.changePassword,</code> <code>.oldPassword,</code> <code>.newPassword,</code> <code>.confirmNewPassword</code> etc. Good programmers like to keep code readable and usable by other Code Reviewers of the team. The risk is that attackers could map these selectors to actual features of a web application.</p>
<h2>Defensive Mechanisms to Mitigate Attacker's Motivation</h2>
<h3>Defense Mechanism</h3>
<p>As a CSS Coder / Programmer, always keep the CSS isolated by access control level. By this, it means <strong>Student</strong> will have a different CSS file called as <code>StudentStyling.CSS</code> while <strong>Administrator</strong> has <code>AdministratorStyling.CSS</code> and so on. Make sure these <code>*.CSS</code> files are accessed only for a user with the proper access control level. Only users with the proper access control level should be able to access their <code>*.CSS</code> file.</p>
<p>If an authenticated user with the <strong>Student</strong> Role tries to access <code>AdministratorStyling.CSS</code> through forced browsing, an alert that an intrusion is occurring should be recorded.</p>
<h3>Defense Mechanism #2</h3>
<p>Being a programmer or a tester, take care of the naming conventions of your CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) Selectors. Obfuscate the selector names in such a fashion that attackers are not informed what a specific selector is linking to.</p>
<p>Example: CSS Selectors for <code>addUser,</code> <code>addAdmin,</code> <code>profileSettings,</code> <code>changePassword</code> could be named <code>aHj879JK,</code> <code>bHjsU,</code> <code>ahkrrE,</code> <code>lOiksn</code> respectively. These names could be randomly generated per user as well.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rename-css-selectors">NPM package</a> can be used to perform the renaming of the CSS selector.</p>
<h3>Defense Mechanism #3</h3>
<p>Web applications that allow users to author content via HTML input could be vulnerable to malicious use of CSS. Uploaded HTML could use styles that are allowed by the web application but could be used for purposes other than intended which could lead to security risks.</p>
<p>Example: You can read about how <a href="https://www.scmagazineuk.com/style-sheet-vulnerability-allowed-attacker-hijack-linkedin-pages/article/1479529">LinkedIn</a> had a vulnerability which allowed malicious use of CSS that lead to the authoring of a page where the entire page was clickable including overwriting LinkedIn's standard navigation elements.</p>
<h1>Injection Prevention</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Injection flaws occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter. Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in legacy code, often found in SQL queries, LDAP queries, XPath queries, OS commands, program arguments, etc. Injection flaws are easy to discover when examining code, but more difficult via testing. Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find them.</p>
<h2>Forms of Injection</h2>
<p>There are several forms of injection targeting different technologies including SQL queries, LDAP queries, XPath queries and OS commands.</p>
<h3>Query languages</h3>
<p>The most famous form of injection is SQL Injection where an attacker can modify existing database queries.</p>
<p>But also LDAP, SOAP, XPath and REST based queries can be susceptible to injection attacks allowing for data retrieval or control bypass.</p>
<h4>SQL Injection</h4>
<p>An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of either a partial or complete SQL query via the data input or transmitted from the client (browser) to the web application.</p>
<p>A successful SQL injection attack can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (insert/update/delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file existing on the DBMS file system or write files into the file system, and, in some cases, issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.</p>
<h5>How to test for the issue</h5>
<h6>During code review</h6>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please check for any queries to the database are not done via prepared statements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If dynamic statements are being made please check if the data is sanitized before used as par of the statement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditors should always look for uses of sp_execute, execute or exec within SQL Server stored procedures. Similar audit guidelines are necessary for similar functions for other vendors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>Automated Exploitation</h6>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To find information about how to perform, tester can use an automated auditing tool such as SQLMap;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equally Static Code Analysis Data flow rules can detect of unsanitized user controlled input can change the SQL query.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>Stored Procedure Injection</h6>
<ul>
<li>When using dynamic SQL within a stored procedure, the application must properly sanitize the user input to eliminate the risk of code injection;</li>
<li>If not sanitized, the user could enter malicious SQL that will be executed within the stored procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Time delay Exploitation technique</h6>
<p>The time delay exploitation technique is very useful when the tester find a Blind SQL Injection situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation.</p>
<h6>Out of band Exploitation technique</h6>
<p>This technique is very useful when the tester find a Blind SQL Injection situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<h6>Defense Option 1: Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)</h6>
<h6>Defense Option 2: Stored Procedures</h6>
<h6>Defense Option 3: Allow-List Input Validation</h6>
<h6>Defense Option 4: Escaping All User-Supplied Input</h6>
<h4>LDAP Injection</h4>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/LDAP_Injection">LDAP injection</a> attacks are common due to two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The lack of safer, parameterized LDAP query interfaces;</li>
<li>The widespread use of LDAP to authenticate users to systems.</li>
</ol>
<h5>How to test for the issue</h5>
<h6>During code review</h6>
<p>Please check for any queries to the LDAP escape special characters, see <a href="LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md#defense-option-1-escape-all-variables-using-the-right-ldap-encoding-function">here</a>.</p>
<h6>Automated Exploitation</h6>
<p>Use scanner module of tool like OWASP <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/">ZAP</a> to detect LDAP injection issue.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<h6>Escape all variables using the right LDAP encoding function</h6>
<h4>XPath Injection</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>Scripting languages</h3>
<p>All scripting languages used in web applications have a form of an <code>eval</code> call which receives code at runtime and executes it. If code is crafted using unvalidated and unescaped user input code injection can occur which allows an attacker to subvert application logic and eventually to gain local access.</p>
<p>Every time a scripting language is used, the actual implementation of the 'higher' scripting language is done using a 'lower' language like C. If the scripting language has a flaw in the data handling code '<a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246949/Null%20Byte%20Injection">Null Byte Injection</a>' attack vectors can be deployed to gain access to other areas in memory, which results in a successful attack.</p>
<h3>Operating System Commands</h3>
<p>OS command injection is a technique used via a web interface in order to execute OS commands on a web server. The user supplies operating system commands through a web interface in order to execute OS commands.</p>
<p>Any web interface that is not properly sanitized is subject to this exploit. With the ability to execute OS commands, the user can upload malicious programs or even obtain passwords. OS command injection is preventable when security is emphasized during the design and development of applications.</p>
<h4>How to test for the issue</h4>
<h5>During code review</h5>
<ul>
<li>Check if any command execute methods are called and in unvalidated user input are taken as data for that command.</li>
<li>Out side of that, appending a semicolon to the end of a URL query parameter followed by an operating system command, will execute the command. <code>%3B</code> is URL encoded and decodes to semicolon. This is because the <code>;</code> is interpreted as a command separator.</li>
<li>If the application responds with the output of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file then you know the attack has been successful. Many web application scanners can be used to test for this attack as they inject variations of command injections and test the response.</li>
<li>Equally Static Code Analysis tools check the data flow of untrusted user input into a web application and check if the data is then entered into a dangerous method which executes the user input as a command.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remediation</h4>
<p>If it is considered unavoidable the call to a system command incorporated with user-supplied, the following two layers of defense should be used within software in order to prevent attacks</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parameterization</strong> - If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and command. These mechanisms can help to provide the relevant quoting, encoding.</li>
<li><strong>Input validation</strong> - the values for commands and the relevant arguments should be both validated. There are different degrees of validation for the actual command and its arguments:<ul>
<li>When it comes to the <strong>commands</strong> used, these must be validated against a list of allowed commands.</li>
<li>In regards to the <strong>arguments</strong> used for these commands, they should be validated using the following options:<ul>
<li>Positive or "allow list" input validation - where are the arguments allowed explicitly defined</li>
<li>Allow-list Regular Expression - where is explicitly defined a list of good characters allowed and the maximum length of the string. Ensure that metacharacters like <code>&amp; | ; $ &gt; &lt; \</code> \ !` and white-spaces are not part of the Regular Expression. For example, the following regular expression only allows lowercase letters and numbers, and does not contain metacharacters. The length is also being limited to 3-10 characters:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>^[a-z0-9]{3,10}$</code></p>
<h3>Network Protocols</h3>
<p>Web applications often communicate with network daemons (like SMTP, IMAP, FTP) where user input becomes part of the communication stream. Here it is possible to inject command sequences to abuse an established session.</p>
<h2>Injection Prevention Rules</h2>
<h3>Rule #1 (Perform proper input validation)</h3>
<p>Perform proper input validation. Positive or "allow list" input validation with appropriate canonicalization is also recommended, but <strong>is not a complete defense</strong> as many applications require special characters in their input.</p>
<h3>Rule #2 (Use a safe API)</h3>
<p>The preferred option is to use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface. Be careful of APIs, such as stored procedures, that are parameterized, but can still introduce injection under the hood.</p>
<h3>Rule #3 (Contextually escape user data)</h3>
<p>If a parameterized API is not available, you should carefully escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.</p>

<h1>NodeJS Security</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guidelines list actions developers can take to develop secure Node.js applications. Each item has a brief explanation and solution that is specific to the Node.js environment.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Node.js applications are increasing in number and they are no different from other frameworks and programming languages. Node.js applications are prone to all kinds of web application vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This cheat sheet aims to provide a list of best practices to follow during development of Node.js applications.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>There are several different recommendations to enhance security of your Node.js applications. These are categorized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Security</strong></li>
<li><strong>Error &amp; Exception Handling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Server Security</strong></li>
<li><strong>Platform Security</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Security</h3>
<h4>Use flat Promise chains</h4>
<p>Asynchronous callback functions are one of the strongest features of Node.js. However, increasing layers of nesting within callback functions can become a problem. Any multistage process can become nested 10 or more levels deep. This problem is referred to as a "Pyramid of Doom" or "Callback Hell". In such code, the errors and results get lost within the callback. Promises are a good way to write asynchronous code without getting into nested pyramids. Promises provide top-down execution while being asynchronous by delivering errors and results to next <code>.then</code> function.</p>
<p>Another advantage of Promises is the way Promises handle errors. If an error occurs in a Promise class, it skips over the <code>.then</code> functions and invokes the first <code>.catch</code> function it finds. This way Promises provide a higher assurance of capturing and handling errors. As a principle, you can make all your asynchronous code (apart from emitters) return promises. It should be noted that Promise calls can also become a pyramid. In order to completely stay away from "Callback Hell", flat Promise chains should be used. If the module you are using does not support Promises, you can convert base object to a Promise by using <code>Promise.promisifyAll()</code> function.</p>
<p>The following code snippet is an example of "Callback Hell":</p>
<p>```JavaScript
function func1(name, callback) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback
}
function func2(name, callback) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback
}
function func3(name, callback) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback
}
function func4(name, callback) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback
}</p>
<p>func1("input1", function(err, result1){
   if(err){
      // error operations
   }
   else {
      //some operations
      func2("input2", function(err, result2){
         if(err){
            //error operations
         }
         else{
            //some operations
            func3("input3", function(err, result3){
               if(err){
                  //error operations
               }
               else{
                  // some operations
                  func4("input 4", function(err, result4){
                     if(err){
                        // error operations
                     }
                     else {
                        // some operations
                     }
                  });
               }
            });
         }
      });
   }
});
```</p>
<p>The above code can be securely written as follows using a flat Promise chain:</p>
<p>```JavaScript
function func1(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function func2(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function func3(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function func4(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}</p>
<p>func1("input1")
   .then(function (result){
      return func2("input2");
   })
   .then(function (result){
      return func3("input3");
   })
   .then(function (result){
      return func4("input4");
   })
   .catch(function (error) {
      // error operations
   });
```</p>
<p>And using async/await:</p>
<p>```JavaScript
function async func1(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function async func2(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function async func3(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}
function async func4(name) {
  // operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise
}</p>
<p>(async() =&gt; {
  try {
    let res1 = await func1("input1");
    let res2 = await func2("input2");
    let res3 = await func3("input2");
    let res4 = await func4("input2");
  } catch(err) {
    // error operations
  }
})();
```</p>
<h4>Set request size limits</h4>
<p>Buffering and parsing of request bodies can be a resource intensive task. If there is no limit on the size of requests, attackers can send requests with large request bodies that can exhaust server memory and/or fill disk space. You can limit the request body size for all requests using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body">raw-body</a>.</p>
<p>```JavaScript
const contentType = require('content-type')
const express = require('express')
const getRawBody = require('raw-body')</p>
<p>const app = express()</p>
<p>app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (!['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'].includes(req.method)) {
    next()
    return
  }</p>
<p>getRawBody(req, {
    length: req.headers['content-length'],
    limit: '1kb',
    encoding: contentType.parse(req).parameters.charset
  }, function (err, string) {
    if (err) return next(err)
    req.text = string
    next()
  })
})
```</p>
<p>However, fixing a request size limit for all requests may not be the correct behavior, since some requests may have a large payload in the request body, such as when uploading a file. Also, input with a JSON type is more dangerous than a multipart input, since parsing JSON is a blocking operation. Therefore, you should set request size limits for different content types. You can accomplish this very easily with express middleware as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "1kb" }));
app.use(express.json({ limit: "1kb" }));</code></p>
<p>It should be noted that attackers can change the <code>Content-Type</code> header of the request and bypass request size limits. Therefore, before processing the request, data contained in the request should be validated against the content type stated in the request headers. If content type validation for each request affects the performance severely, you can only validate specific content types or request larger than a predetermined size.</p>
<h4>Do not block the event loop</h4>
<p>Node.js is very different from common application platforms that use threads. Node.js has a single-thread event-driven architecture. By means of this architecture, throughput becomes high and the programming model becomes simpler. Node.js is implemented around a non-blocking I/O event loop. With this event loop, there is no waiting on I/O or context switching. The event loop looks for events and dispatches them to handler functions. Because of this, when CPU intensive JavaScript operations are executed, the event loop waits for them to finish. This is why such operations are called "blocking". To overcome this problem, Node.js allows assigning callbacks to IO-blocked events. This way, the main application is not blocked and callbacks run asynchronously. Therefore, as a general principle, all blocking operations should be done asynchronously so that the event loop is not blocked.</p>
<p>Even if you perform blocking operations asynchronously, your application may still not serve as expected. This happens if there is a code outside the callback that relies on the code within the callback to run first. For example, consider the following code:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {
  // perform actions on file content
});
fs.unlinkSync('/file.txt');</code></p>
<p>In the above example, <code>unlinkSync</code> function may run before the callback, which will delete the file before the desired actions on the file content is done. Such race conditions can also affect the security of your application. An example would be a scenario where authentication is performed in a callback and authenticated actions are run synchronously. In order to eliminate such race conditions, you can write all operations that rely on each other in a single non-blocking function. By doing so, you can guarantee that all operations are executed in the correct order. For example, above code example can be written in a non-blocking way as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {
  // perform actions on file content
  fs.unlink('/file.txt', (err) =&gt; {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
});</code></p>
<p>In the above code, call to unlink the file and other file operations are within the same callback. This provides the correct order of operations.</p>
<h4>Perform input validation</h4>
<p>Input validation is a crucial part of application security. Input validation failures can result in many different types of application attacks. These include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Command Injection, Local/Remote File Inclusion, Denial of Service, Directory Traversal, LDAP Injection and many other injection attacks. In order to avoid these attacks, input to your application should be sanitized first. The best input validation technique is to use a list of accepted inputs. However, if this is not possible, input should be first checked against expected input scheme and dangerous inputs should be escaped. In order to ease input validation in Node.js applications, there are some modules like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator">validator</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-express-sanitize">mongo-express-sanitize</a>.
For detailed information on input validation, please refer to <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html">Input Validation Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a dynamic language and depending on how the framework parses a URL, the data seen by the application code can take on many different forms. Here are some examples after parsing a query string in express.js:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>URL</th>
<th>Content of request.query.foo in code</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo=bar</code></td>
<td><code>'bar'</code> (string)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo=bar&amp;foo=baz</code></td>
<td><code>['bar', 'baz']</code> (array of string)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[]=bar</code></td>
<td><code>['bar']</code> (array of string)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[]=bar&amp;foo[]=baz</code></td>
<td><code>['bar', 'baz']</code> (array of string)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[bar]=baz</code></td>
<td><code>{ bar : 'baz' }</code> (object with a key)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[]=bar</code></td>
<td><code>['bar']</code> (array of string)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[]baz=bar</code></td>
<td><code>['bar']</code> (array of string - postfix is lost)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[][baz]=bar</code></td>
<td><code>[ { baz: 'bar' } ]</code> (array of object)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[bar][baz]=bar</code></td>
<td><code>{ foo: { bar: { baz: 'bar' } } }</code> (object tree)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[10]=bar&amp;foo[9]=baz</code></td>
<td><code>[ 'baz', 'bar' ]</code> (array of string - notice order)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>?foo[toString]=bar</code></td>
<td><code>{}</code> (object where calling <code>toString()</code> will fail)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Perform output escaping</h4>
<p>In addition to input validation, you should escape all HTML and JavaScript content shown to users via application in order to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You can use <a href="https://github.com/component/escape-html">escape-html</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ESAPI/node-esapi">node-esapi</a> libraries to perform output escaping.</p>
<h4>Perform application activity logging</h4>
<p>Logging application activity is an encouraged good practice. It makes it easier to debug any errors encountered during application runtime. It is also useful for security concerns, since it can be used during incident response. In addition, these logs can be used to feed Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). In Node.js, there are modules such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston">Winston</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan">Bunyan</a>, or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino">Pino</a> to perform application activity logging. These modules enable streaming and querying logs, and they provide a way to handle uncaught exceptions.</p>
<p>With the following code, you can log application activities in both console and a desired log file:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const logger = new (Winston.Logger) ({
    transports: [
        new (winston.transports.Console)(),
        new (winston.transports.File)({ filename: 'application.log' })
    ],
    level: 'verbose'
});</code></p>
<p>You can provide different transports so that you can save errors to a separate log file and general application logs to a different log file. Additional information on security logging can be found in <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html">Logging Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<h4>Monitor the event loop</h4>
<p>When your application server is under heavy network traffic, it may not be able to serve its users. This is essentially a type of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Denial_of_Service_Cheat_Sheet.html">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attack. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/toobusy-js">toobusy-js</a> module allows you to monitor the event loop. It keeps track of the response time, and when it goes beyond a certain threshold, this module can indicate your server is too busy. In that case, you can stop processing incoming requests and send them <code>503 Server Too Busy</code> message so that your application stay responsive. Example use of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/toobusy-js">toobusy-js</a> module is shown here:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const toobusy = require('toobusy-js');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    if (toobusy()) {
        // log if you see necessary
        res.send(503, "Server Too Busy");
    } else {
    next();
    }
});</code></p>
<h4>Take precautions against brute-forcing</h4>
<p><a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#protect-against-automated-attacks">Brute-forcing</a> is a common threat to all web applications. Attackers can use brute-forcing as a password guessing attack to obtain account passwords. Therefore, application developers should take precautions against brute-force attacks especially in login pages.  Node.js has several modules available for this purpose. <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-bouncer">Express-bouncer</a>, <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-brute">express-brute</a> and <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/rate-limiter">rate-limiter</a> are just some examples. Based on your needs and requirements, you should choose one or more of these modules and use accordingly. <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-bouncer">Express-bouncer</a> and <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-brute">express-brute</a> modules work very similar and they both increase the delay with each failed request. They can both be arranged for a specific route. These modules can be used as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const bouncer = require('express-bouncer');
bouncer.whitelist.push('127.0.0.1'); // allow an IP address
// give a custom error message
bouncer.blocked = function (req, res, next, remaining) {
    res.send(429, "Too many requests have been made. Please wait " + remaining/1000 + " seconds.");
};
// route to protect
app.post("/login", bouncer.block, function(req, res) {
    if (LoginFailed){  }
    else {
        bouncer.reset( req );
    }
});</code></p>
<p>```JavaScript
const ExpressBrute = require('express-brute');</p>
<p>const store = new ExpressBrute.MemoryStore(); // stores state locally, don't use this in production
const bruteforce = new ExpressBrute(store);</p>
<p>app.post('/auth',
    bruteforce.prevent, // error 429 if we hit this route too often
    function (req, res, next) {
        res.send('Success!');
    }
);
```</p>
<p>Apart from <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-bouncer">express-bouncer</a> and <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/express-brute">express-brute</a>, the <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/rate-limiter">rate-limiter</a> module can also help to prevent brute-forcing attacks. It enables specifying how many requests a specific IP address can make during a specified time period.</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const limiter = new RateLimiter();
limiter.addLimit('/login', 'GET', 5, 500); // login page can be requested 5 times at max within 500 seconds</code></p>
<p><a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Credential_Stuffing_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#captcha">CAPTCHA usage</a> is also another common mechanism used against brute-forcing. There are modules developed for Node.js CAPTCHAs. A common module used in Node.js applications is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-captcha">svg-captcha</a>. It can be used as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const svgCaptcha = require('svg-captcha');
app.get('/captcha', function (req, res) {
    const captcha = svgCaptcha.create();
    req.session.captcha = captcha.text;
    res.type('svg');
    res.status(200).send(captcha.data);
});</code></p>
<p><a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#account-lockout">Account lockout</a> is a recommended solution to keep attackers away from your valid users. Account lockout is possible with many modules like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose">mongoose</a>. You can refer to <a href="http://devsmash.com/blog/implementing-max-login-attempts-with-mongoose">this blog post</a> to see how account lockout is implemented in mongoose.</p>
<h4>Use Anti-CSRF tokens</h4>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> aims to perform authorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user, while the user is unaware of this action. CSRF attacks are generally performed for state-changing requests like changing a password, adding users or placing orders. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf">Csurf</a> is an express middleware that can be used to mitigate CSRF attacks. It can be used as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const csrf = require('csurf');
csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });
app.get('/form', csrfProtection, function(req, res) {
    res.render('send', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() })
})
app.post('/process', parseForm, csrfProtection, function(req, res) {
    res.send('data is being processed');
});</code></p>
<p>After writing this code, you also need to add <code>csrfToken</code> to your HTML form, which can be easily done as follows:</p>
<p><code>HTML
&lt;input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="{{ csrfToken }}"&gt;</code></p>
<p>For detailed information on cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and prevention methods, you can refer to <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention</a>.</p>
<h4>Remove unnecessary routes</h4>
<p>A web application should not contain any page that is not used by users, as it may increase the attack surface of the application. Therefore, all unused API routes should be disabled in Node.js applications. This occurs especially in frameworks like <a href="https://sailsjs.com">Sails</a> and <a href="https://feathersjs.com">Feathers</a>, as they automatically generate REST API endpoints. For example, in <a href="https://sailsjs.com">Sails</a>, if a URL does not match a custom route, it may match one of the automatic routes and still generate a response. This situation may lead to results ranging from information leakage to arbitrary command execution. Therefore, before using such frameworks and modules, it is important to know the routes they automatically generate and remove or disable these routes.</p>
<h4>Prevent HTTP Parameter Pollution</h4>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution.html">HTTP Parameter Pollution(HPP)</a> is an attack in which attackers send multiple HTTP parameters with the same name and this causes your application to interpret them in an unpredictable way. When multiple parameter values are sent, Express populates them in an array. In order to solve this issue, you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hpp">hpp</a> module. When used, this module will ignore all values submitted for a parameter in <code>req.query</code> and/or <code>req.body</code> and just select the last parameter value submitted. You can use it as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const hpp = require('hpp');
app.use(hpp());</code></p>
<h4>Only return what is necessary</h4>
<p>Information about the users of an application is among the most critical information about the application. User tables generally include fields like id, username, full name, email address, birth date, password and in some cases social security numbers. Therefore, when querying and using user objects, you need to return only needed fields as it may be vulnerable to personal information disclosure. This is also correct for other objects stored on the database. If you just need a certain field of an object, you should only return the specific fields required. As an example, you can use a function like the following whenever you need to get information on a user. By doing so, you can only return the fields that are needed for your specific operation. In other words, if you only need to list names of the users available, you are not returning their email addresses or credit card numbers in addition to their full names.</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
exports.sanitizeUser = function(user) {
  return {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    fullName: user.fullName
  };
};</code></p>
<h4>Use object property descriptors</h4>
<p>Object properties include three hidden attributes: <code>writable</code> (if false, property value cannot be changed), <code>enumerable</code> (if false, property cannot be used in for loops) and <code>configurable</code> (if false, property cannot be deleted). When defining an object property through assignment, these three hidden attributes are set to true by default. These properties can be set as follows:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const o = {};
Object.defineProperty(o, "a", {
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true,
    value: "A"
});</code></p>
<p>Apart from these, there are some special functions for object attributes. <code>Object.preventExtensions()</code> prevents new properties from being added to the object.</p>
<h4>Use access control lists</h4>
<p>Authorization prevents users from acting outside of their intended permissions. In order to do so, users and their roles should be determined with consideration of the principle of least privilege. Each user role should only have access to the resources they must use. For your Node.js applications, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/acl">acl</a> module to provide ACL (access control list) implementation. With this module, you can create roles and assign users to these roles.</p>
<h3>Error &amp; Exception Handling</h3>
<h4>Handle uncaughtException</h4>
<p>Node.js behavior for uncaught exceptions is to print current stack trace and then terminate the thread. However, Node.js allows customization of this behavior. It provides a global object named process that is available to all Node.js applications. It is an EventEmitter object and in case of an uncaught exception, uncaughtException event is emitted and it is brought up to the main event loop. In order to provide a custom behavior for uncaught exceptions, you can bind to this event. However, resuming the application after such an uncaught exception can lead to further problems. Therefore, if you do not want to miss any uncaught exception, you should bind to uncaughtException event and cleanup any allocated resources like file descriptors, handles and similar before shutting down the process. Resuming the application is strongly discouraged as the application will be in an unknown state. It is important to note that when displaying error messages to the user in case of an uncaught exception, detailed information like stack traces should not be revealed to the user. Instead, custom error messages should be shown to the users in order not to cause any information leakage.</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
process.on("uncaughtException", function(err) {
    // clean up allocated resources
    // log necessary error details to log files
    process.exit(); // exit the process to avoid unknown state
});</code></p>
<h4>Listen to errors when using EventEmitter</h4>
<p>When using EventEmitter, errors can occur anywhere in the event chain. Normally, if an error occurs in an EventEmitter object, an error event that has an Error object as an argument is called. However, if there are no attached listeners to that error event, the Error object that is sent as an argument is thrown and becomes an uncaught exception. In short, if you do not handle errors within an EventEmitter object properly, these unhandled errors may crash your application. Therefore, you should always listen to error events when using EventEmitter objects.</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const events = require('events');
const myEventEmitter = function(){
    events.EventEmitter.call(this);
}
require('util').inherits(myEventEmitter, events.EventEmitter);
myEventEmitter.prototype.someFunction = function(param1, param2) {
    //in case of an error
    this.emit('error', err);
}
const emitter = new myEventEmitter();
emitter.on('error', function(err){
    //Perform necessary error handling here
});</code></p>
<h4>Handle errors in asynchronous calls</h4>
<p>Errors that occur within asynchronous callbacks are easy to miss. Therefore, as a general principle first argument to the asynchronous calls should be an Error object. Also, express routes handle errors itself, but it should be always remembered that errors occurred in asynchronous calls made within express routes are not handled, unless an Error object is sent as a first argument.</p>
<p>Errors in these callbacks can be propagated as many times as possible. Each callback that the error has been propagated to can ignore, handle or propagate the error.</p>
<h3>Server Security</h3>
<h4>Set cookie flags appropriately</h4>
<p>Generally, session information is sent using cookies in web applications. However, improper use of HTTP cookies can render an application to several session management vulnerabilities. Some flags can be set for each cookie to prevent these kinds of attacks. <code>httpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code> and <code>SameSite</code> flags are very important for session cookies. <code>httpOnly</code> flag prevents the cookie from being accessed by client-side JavaScript. This is an effective counter-measure for XSS attacks. <code>Secure</code> flag lets the cookie to be sent only if the communication is over HTTPS. <code>SameSite</code> flag can prevent cookies from being sent in cross-site requests that helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Apart from these, there are other flags like domain, path and expires. Setting these flags appropriately is encouraged, but they are mostly related to cookie scope not the cookie security. Sample usage of these flags is given in the following example:</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
const session = require('express-session');
app.use(session({
    secret: 'your-secret-key',
    key: 'cookieName',
    cookie: { secure: true, httpOnly: true, path: '/user', sameSite: true}
}));</code></p>
<h4>Use appropriate security headers</h4>
<p>There are several different <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/">HTTP security headers</a> that can help you prevent some common attack vectors. These are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">Strict-Transport-Security</a></strong>: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> dictates browsers that the application can only be accessed via HTTPS connections. In order to use it in your application, add the following codes:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.hsts()); // default configuration
app.use(helmet.hsts("&lt;max-age&gt;", "&lt;includeSubdomains&gt;")); // custom configuration</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options">X-Frame-Options</a>:</strong> determines if a page can be loaded via a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. Allowing the page to be framed may result in <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking">Clickjacking</a> attacks. This header can be used with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet">helmet</a> module as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.xframe()); // default behavior (DENY)
helmet.xframe('sameorigin'); // SAMEORIGIN
helmet.xframe('allow-from', 'http://alloweduri.com'); //ALLOW-FROM uri</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection">X-XSS-Protection</a>:</strong> As described in the <a href="Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md#x-xss-protection-header">XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet</a>, this header should be set to <code>0</code> to disable the XSS Auditor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/helmetjs/x-xss-protection/issues/14">issue</a> was created in the <a href="https://github.com/helmetjs/">helmetjs</a> project to be able to set the header to <code>0</code>. Once it is updated, this section will be updated to inform the user to disable the XSS auditor properly using helmetjs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options">X-Content-Type-Options</a>:</strong> Even if the server sets a valid <code>Content-Type</code> header in the response, browsers may try to sniff the MIME type of the requested resource. This header is a way to stop this behavior and tell the browser not to change MIME types specified in <code>Content-Type</code> header. It can be configured in the following way:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.noSniff());</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy">Content-Security-Policy</a>:</strong> Content Security Policy is developed to reduce the risk of attacks like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a> and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking">Clickjacking</a>. It allows content from a list that you decide. It has several directives each of which prohibits loading specific type of a content. You can refer to <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html">Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet</a> for detailed explanation of each directive and how to use it. You can implement these settings in your application as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
const csp = require('helmet-csp')
app.use(csp({
   directives: {
       defaultSrc: ["'self'"],  // default value for all directives that are absent
       scriptSrc: ["'self'"],   // helps prevent XSS attacks
       frameAncestors: ["'none'"],  // helps prevent Clickjacking attacks
       imgSrc: ["'self'", "'http://imgexample.com'"],
       styleSrc: ["'none'"]
    }
}))</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Pragma">Pragma</a>:</strong> Cache-Control header can be used to prevent browsers from caching the given responses. This should be done for pages that contain sensitive information about either the user or the application. However, disabling caching for pages that do not contain sensitive information may seriously affect the performance of the application. Therefore, caching should only be disabled for pages that return sensitive information. Appropriate caching controls and headers can be used easily by the following code:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.noCache());</code></p>
<p>The above code sets Cache-Control, Surrogate-Control, Pragma and Expires headers accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Download-Options:</strong> This header prevents Internet Explorer from executing downloaded files in the site's context. This is achieved with noopen directive. You can do so with the following piece of code:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen());</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expect-CT">Expect-CT</a>:</strong> Certificate Transparency is a new mechanism developed to fix some structural problems regarding current SSL infrastructure. Expect-CT header may enforce certificate transparency requirements. It can be implemented in your application as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
const expectCt = require('expect-ct');
app.use(expectCt({ maxAge: 123 }));
app.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123 }));
app.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123, reportUri: 'http://example.com'}));</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Public-Key-Pins">Public-Key-Pins</a>:</strong> This header increases the security of HTTPS. With this header, a specific cryptographic public key is associated with a specific web server. If the server does not use the pinned keys in future, the browser regards the responses as illegitimate. It can be used as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.hpkp({
    maxAge: 123,
    sha256s: ['Ab3Ef123=', 'ZyxawuV45='],
    reportUri: 'http://example.com',
    includeSubDomains: true
}));</code></p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#consider-using-public-key-pinning">Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet</a>, the decision to use public key pinning should be made with careful consideration, since it may cause locking out users for a long time if used incorrectly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Powered-By:</strong> X-Powered-By header is used to inform what technology is used in the server side. This is an unnecessary header causing information leakage, so it should be removed from your application. To do so, you can use the <code>hidePoweredBy</code> as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy());</code></p>
<p>Also, you can lie about the technologies used with this header. For example, even if your application does not use PHP, you can set X-Powered-By header to seem so.</p>
<p><code>JavaScript
app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }));</code></p>
<h3>Platform Security</h3>
<h4>Keep your packages up-to-date</h4>
<p>Security of your application depends directly on how secure the third-party packages you use in your application are. Therefore, it is important to keep your packages up-to-date. It should be noted that <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a> is still in the OWASP Top 10. You can use <a href="https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/analyzers/nodejs.html">OWASP Dependency-Check</a> to see if any of the packages used in the project has a known vulnerability. Also you can use <a href="https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/">Retire.js</a> to check JavaScript libraries with known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Starting with version 6, <code>npm</code> introduced <code>audit</code>, which will warn about vulnerable packages:</p>
<p><code>bash
npm audit</code></p>
<p><code>npm</code> also introduced a simple way to upgrade the affected packages:</p>
<p><code>bash
npm audit fix</code></p>
<p>There are several other tools you can use to check your dependencies. A more comprehensive list can be found in <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerable_Dependency_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#tools">Vulnerable Dependency Management CS</a>.</p>
<h4>Do not use dangerous functions</h4>
<p>There are some JavaScript functions that are dangerous and should only be used where necessary or unavoidable. The first example is the <code>eval()</code> function. This function takes a string argument and executes it as any other JavaScript source code. Combined with user input, this behavior inherently leads to remote code execution vulnerability. Similarly, calls to <code>child_process.exec</code> are also very dangerous. This function acts as a bash interpreter and sends its arguments to /bin/sh. By injecting input to this function, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.</p>
<p>In addition to these functions, some modules require special care when being used. As an example, <code>fs</code> module handles filesystem operations. However, if improperly sanitized user input is fed into this module, your application may become vulnerable to file inclusion and directory traversal vulnerabilities. Similarly, <code>vm</code> module provides APIs for compiling and running code within V8 Virtual Machine contexts. Since it can perform dangerous actions by nature, it should be used within a sandbox.</p>
<p>It would not be fair to say that these functions and modules should not be used whatsoever, however, they should be used carefully especially when they use with user input. Also, there are <a href="https://github.com/wisec/domxsswiki/wiki/Direct-Execution-Sinks">some other functions</a> that may render your application vulnerable.</p>
<h4>Stay away from evil regexes</h4>
<p>The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">The Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</a> is a type of Denial of Service attack that uses regular expressions. Some Regular Expression (Regex) implementations cause extreme situations that makes the application very slow. Attackers can use such regex implementations to cause application to get into these extreme situations and hang for a long time.  Such regexes are called evil if application can be stuck on crafted input.  Generally, these regexes are exploited by grouping with repetition and alternation with overlapping. For example, the following regular expression <code>^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$</code> can be used to specify Java class names. However, a very long string (aaaa...aaaaAaaaaa...aaaa) can also match with this regular expression. There are some tools to check if a regex has a potential for causing denial of service. One example is <a href="https://github.com/davisjam/vuln-regex-detector">vuln-regex-detector</a>.</p>
<h4>Run security linters</h4>
<p>When developing code, keeping all security tips in mind can be really difficult. Also keeping all team members obey these rules is nearly impossible. This is why there are Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools. These tools do not execute your code, but they simply look for patterns that can contain security risks. As JavaScript is a dynamic and loosely-typed language, linting tools are really essential in the software development life cycle. The linting rules should be reviewed periodically and the findings should be audited. Another advantage of these tools is the feature that you can add custom rules for patterns that you may see dangerous. <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> and <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> are commonly used SAST tools for JavaScript linting.</p>
<h4>Use strict mode</h4>
<p>JavaScript has a number of unsafe and dangerous legacy features that should not be used. In order to remove these features, ES5 included a strict mode for developers. With this mode, errors that were silent previously are thrown. It also helps JavaScript engines perform optimizations. With strict mode, previously accepted bad syntax causes real errors. Because of these improvements, you should always use strict mode in your application. In order to enable strict mode, you just need to write <code>"use strict";</code> on top of your code.</p>
<p>The following code will generate a <code>ReferenceError: Can't find variable: y</code> on the console, which will not be displayed unless strict mode is used:</p>
<p>```JavaScript
"use strict";</p>
<p>func();
function func() {
  y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error (y is not defined)
}
```</p>
<h4>Adhere to general application security principles</h4>
<p>This list mainly focuses on issues that are common in Node.js applications, with recommendations and examples. In addition to these, there are general <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles">security by design principles</a> that apply to web applications regardless of technologies used in application server. You should also keep those principles in mind while developing your applications. You can always refer to <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/">OWASP Cheat Sheet Series</a> to learn more about web application vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques used against them.</p>

<h1>NPM Security best practices</h1>
<p>These guidelines focus on <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/ten-npm-security-best-practices">10 npm security best practices</a> and productivity tips, useful for JavaScript and Node.js developers.</p>
<h2>1) Avoid publishing secrets to the npm registry</h2>
<p>Whether you’re making use of API keys, passwords or other secrets, they can very easily end up leaking into source control or even a published package on the public npm registry. You may have secrets in your working directory in designated files such as a <code>.env</code> which should be added to a <code>.gitignore</code> to avoid committing it to a SCM, but what happen when you publish an npm package from the project’s directory?</p>
<p>The npm CLI packs up a project into a tar archive (tarball) in order to push it to the registry. The following criteria determine which files and directories are added to the tarball:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is either a <code>.gitignore</code> or a <code>.npmignore</code> file, the contents of the file are used as an ignore pattern when preparing the package for publication.</li>
<li>If both ignore files exist, everything not located in <code>.npmignore</code> is published to the registry. This condition is a common source of confusion and is a problem that can lead to leaking secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers may end up updating the <code>.gitignore</code> file, but forget to update <code>.npmignore</code> as well, which can lead to a potentially sensitive file not being pushed to source control, but still being included in the npm package.</p>
<p>Another good practice to adopt is making use of the <code>files</code> property in package.json, which works as a whitelist and specifies the array of files to be included in the package that is to be created and installed (while the ignore file functions as a blacklist). The <code>files</code> property and an ignore file can both be used together to determine which files should explicitly be included, as well as excluded, from the package. When using both, the former the <code>files</code> property in package.json takes precedence over the ignore file.</p>
<p>When a package is published, the npm CLI will verbosely display the archive being created. To be extra careful, add a <code>--dry-run</code> command-line argument to your publish command in order to first review how the tarball is created without actually publishing it to the registry.</p>
<p>In January 2019, npm shared on their blog that they added a <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/182015409750/automated-token-revocation-for-when-you">mechanism that automatically revokes a token</a> if they detect that one has been published with a package.</p>
<h2>2) Enforce the lockfile</h2>
<p>We embraced the birth of package lockfiles with open arms, which introduced: deterministic installations across different environments, and enforced dependency expectations across team collaboration. Life is good! Or so I thought… what would have happened had I slipped a change into the project’s <code>package.json</code> file but had forgotten to commit the lockfile along side of it?</p>
<p>Both Yarn, and npm act the same during dependency installation . When they detect an inconsistency between the project’s <code>package.json</code> and the lockfile, they compensate for such change based on the <code>package.json</code> manifest by installing different versions than those that were recorded in the lockfile.</p>
<p>This kind of situation can be hazardous for build and production environments as they could pull in unintended package versions and render the entire benefit of a lockfile futile.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a way to tell both Yarn and npm to adhere to a specified set of dependencies and their versions by referencing them from the lockfile. Any inconsistency will abort the installation. The command-line should read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using Yarn, run <code>yarn install --frozen-lockfile</code>.</li>
<li>If you’re using npm run <code>npm ci</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3) Minimize attack surfaces by ignoring run-scripts</h2>
<p>The npm CLI works with package run-scripts. If you’ve ever run <code>npm start</code> or <code>npm test</code> then you’ve used package run-scripts too. The npm CLI builds on scripts that a package can declare, and allows packages to define scripts to run at specific entry points during the package’s installation in a project. For example, some of these <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">script hook</a> entries may be <code>postinstall</code> scripts that a package that is being installed will execute in order to perform housekeeping chores.</p>
<p>With this capability, bad actors may create or alter packages to perform malicious acts by running any arbitrary command when their package is installed. A couple of cases where we’ve seen this already happening is the popular <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:eslint-scope:20180712">eslint-scope incident</a> that harvested npm tokens, and the <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:crossenv:20170802">crossenv incident</a>, along with 36 other packages that abused a typosquatting attack on the npm registry.</p>
<p>Apply these npm security best practices in order to minimize the malicious module attack surface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always vet and perform due-diligence on third-party modules that you install in order to confirm their health and credibility.</li>
<li>Hold-off on upgrading immediately to new versions; allow new package versions some time to circulate before trying them out.</li>
<li>Before upgrading, make sure to review changelog and release notes for the upgraded version.</li>
<li>When installing packages make sure to add the <code>--ignore-scripts</code> suffix to disable the execution of any scripts by third-party packages.</li>
<li>Consider adding <code>ignore-scripts</code> to your <code>.npmrc</code> project file, or to your global npm configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Assess npm project health</h2>
<h3>npm outdated command</h3>
<p>Rushing to constantly upgrade dependencies to their latest releases is not necessarily a good practice if it is done without reviewing release notes, the code changes, and generally testing new upgrades in a comprehensive manner. With that said, staying out of date and not upgrading at all, or after a long time, is a source for trouble as well.</p>
<p>The npm CLI can provide information about the freshness of dependencies you use with regards to their semantic versioning offset. By running <code>npm outdated</code>, you can see which packages are out of date. Dependencies in yellow correspond to the semantic versioning as specified in the package.json manifest, and dependencies colored in red mean that there’s an update available. Furthermore, the output also shows the latest version for each dependency.</p>
<h3>npm doctor command</h3>
<p>Between the variety of Node.js package managers, and different versions of Node.js you may have installed in your path, how do you verify a healthy npm installation and working environment? Whether you’re working with the npm CLI in a development environment or within a CI, it is important to assess that everything is working as expected.</p>
<p>Call the doctor! The npm CLI incorporates a health assessment tool to diagnose your environment for a well-working npm interaction. Run <code>npm doctor</code> to review your npm setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the official npm registry is reachable, and display the currently configured registry.</li>
<li>Check that Git is available.</li>
<li>Review installed npm and Node.js versions.</li>
<li>Run permission checks on the various folders such as the local and global <code>node_modules</code>, and on the folder used for package cache.</li>
<li>Check the local npm module cache for checksum correctness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5) Audit for vulnerabilities in open source dependencies</h2>
<p>The npm ecosystem is the single largest repository of application libraries amongst all the other language ecosystems. The registry and the libraries in it are at the core for JavaScript developers as they are able to leverage work that others have already built and incorporate it into their codebase. With that said, the increasing adoption of open source libraries in applications brings with it an increased risk of introducing security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Many popular npm packages have been found to be vulnerable and may carry a significant risk without proper security auditing of your project’s dependencies. Some examples are npm <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:request:20160119">request</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=superagent&amp;type=npm">superagent</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=mongoose&amp;type=npm">mongoose</a>, and even security-related packages like <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jsonwebtoken:20150331">jsonwebtoken</a>, and  <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=validator&amp;type=npm">validator</a>.</p>
<p>Security doesn’t end by just scanning for security vulnerabilities when installing a package but should also be streamlined with developer workflows to be effectively adopted throughout the entire lifecycle of software development, and monitored continuously when code is deployed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan for security vulnerabilities in <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Component_Analysis">third-party open source projects</a></li>
<li>Monitor snapshots of your project's manifests so you can receive alerts when new CVEs impact them</li>
</ul>
<h2>6) Use a local npm proxy</h2>
<p>The npm registry is the biggest collection of packages that is available for all JavaScript developers and is also the home of the most of the Open Source projects for web developers. But sometimes you might have different needs in terms of security, deployments or performance. When this is true, npm allows you to switch to a different registry:</p>
<p>When you run <code>npm install</code>, it automatically starts a communication with the main registry to resolve all your dependencies; if you wish to use a different registry, that too is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>npm set registry</code> to set up a default registry.</li>
<li>Use the argument <code>--registry</code> for one single registry.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://verdaccio.org/">Verdaccio</a> is a simple lightweight zero-config-required private registry and installing it is as simple as follows: <code>$ npm install --global verdaccio</code>.</p>
<p>Hosting your own registry was never so easy! Let’s check the most important features of this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports the npm registry format including private package features, scope support, package access control and authenticated users in the web interface.</li>
<li>It provides capabilities to hook remote registries and the power to route each dependency to different registries and caching tarballs. To reduce duplicate downloads and save bandwidth in your local development and CI servers, you should proxy all dependencies.</li>
<li>As an authentication provider by default, it uses an htpasswd security, but also supports Gitlab, Bitbucket, LDAP. You can also use your own.</li>
<li>It’s easy to scale using a different storage provider.</li>
<li>If your project is based in Docker, using the official image is the best choice.</li>
<li>It enables really fast bootstrap for testing environments, and is handy for testing big mono-repos projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7) Responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>When security vulnerabilities are found, they pose a potentially serious threat if publicly disclosed without prior warning or appropriate mitigation available for users to protect themselves.</p>
<p>It is recommended that security researchers follow a responsible disclosure program, which is a set of processes and guidelines that aims to connect the researchers with the vendor or maintainer of the vulnerable asset, in order to convey the vulnerability, it’s impact and applicability. Once the vulnerability is correctly triaged, the vendor and researcher coordinate a fix and a publication date for the vulnerability in an effort to provide an upgrade-path or remediation for affected users before the security issue is made public.</p>
<h2>8) Enable 2FA</h2>
<p>In October 2017, npm officially announced support for two-factor authentication (2FA) for developers using the npm registry to host their closed and open source packages.</p>
<p>Even though 2FA has been supported on the npm registry for a while now, it seems to be slowly adopted with one example being the eslint-scope incident in mid-2018 when a stolen developer account on the ESLint team lead to a <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:eslint-scope">malicious version of eslint-scope</a> being published by bad actors.</p>
<p>Enabling 2FA is an easy and significant win for an npm security best practices. The registry supports two modes for enabling 2FA in a user’s account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization-only—when a user logs in to npm via the website or the CLI, or performs other sets of actions such as changing profile information.</li>
<li>Authorization and write-mode—profile and log-in actions, as well as write actions such as managing tokens and packages, and minor support for team and package visibility information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equip yourself with an authentication application, such as Google Authentication, which you can install on a mobile device, and you’re ready to get started. One easy way to get started with the 2FA extended protection for your account is through npm’s user interface, which allows enabling it very easily. If you’re a command-line person, it’s also easy to enable 2FA when using a supported npm client version (&gt;=5.5.1):</p>
<p><code>sh
npm profile enable-2fa auth-and-writes</code></p>
<p>Follow the command-line instructions to enable 2FA, and to save emergency authentication codes. If you wish to enable 2FA mode for login and profile changes only, you may replace the <code>auth-and-writes</code> with <code>auth-only</code> in the code as it appears above.</p>
<h2>9) Use npm author tokens</h2>
<p>Every time you log in with the npm CLI, a token is generated for your user and authenticates you to the npm registry. Tokens make it easy to perform npm registry-related actions during CI and automated procedures, such as accessing private modules on the registry or publishing new versions from a build step.</p>
<p>Tokens can be managed through the npm registry website, as well as using the npm command-line client. An example of using the CLI to create  a read-only token that is restricted to a specific IPv4 address range is as follows:</p>
<p><code>sh
npm token create --read-only --cidr=192.0.2.0/24</code></p>
<p>To verify which tokens are created for your user or to revoke tokens in cases of emergency, you can use <code>npm token list</code> or <code>npm token revoke</code> respectively.</p>
<p>Ensure you are following this npm security best practice by protecting and minimizing the exposure of your npm tokens.</p>
<h2>10) Understand module naming conventions and typosquatting attacks</h2>
<p>Naming a module is the first thing you might do when creating a package, but before defining a final name, npm defines some rules that a package name must follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is limited to 214 characters</li>
<li>It cannot start with dot or underscore</li>
<li>No uppercase letters in the name</li>
<li>No trailing spaces</li>
<li>Only lowercase</li>
<li>Some special characters are not allowed: “~\’!()*”)’</li>
<li>Can’t start with . or _</li>
<li>Can’t use node_modules or favicon.ico due are banned</li>
<li>Even if you follow these rules, be aware that npm uses a spam detection mechanism when publishing new packages, based on score and whether a package name violates the terms of the service. If conditions are violated, the registry might deny the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typosquatting is an attack that relies on mistakes made by users, such as typos. With typosquatting, bad actors could publish malicious modules to the npm registry with names that look much like existing popular modules.</p>
<p>We have been tracking tens of malicious packages in the npm ecosystem; they have been seen on the PyPi Python registry as well. Perhaps some of the most popular incidents have been for <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:crossenv:20170802">cross-env</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-EVENTSTREAM-72638">event-stream</a>, and <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:eslint-scope:20180712">eslint-scope</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main targets for typosquatting attacks are the user credentials, since any package has access to environment variables via the global variable process.env. Other examples we’ve seen in the past include the case with event-stream, where the attack targeted developers in the hopes of <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor">injecting malicious code</a> into an application’s source code.</p>
<p>Closing our list of ten npm security best practices are the following tips to reduce the risk of such attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be extra-careful when copy-pasting package installation instructions into the terminal. Make sure to verify in the source code repository as well as on the npm registry that this is indeed the package you are intending to install. You might verify the metadata of the package with <code>npm info</code> to fetch more information about contributors and latest versions.</li>
<li>Default to having an npm logged-out user in your daily work routines so your credentials won’t be the weak spot that would lead to easily compromising your account.</li>
<li>When installing packages, append the <code>--ignore-scripts</code> to reduce the risk of arbitrary command execution. For example: <code>npm install my-malicious-package --ignore-scripts</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Third Party JavaScript Management</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tags, aka marketing tags, analytics tags etc. are small bits of JavaScript on a web page. They can also be HTML image elements when JavaScript is disabled. The reason for them is to collect data on the web user actions and browsing context for use by the web page owner in marketing.</p>
<p>Third party vendor JavaScript tags (hereinafter, <strong>tags</strong>) can be divided into two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface tags.</li>
<li>Analytic tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>User interface tags have to execute on the client because they change the DOM; displaying a dialog or image or changing text etc.</p>
<p>Analytics tags send information back to a marketing information database; information like what user action was just taken, browser metadata, location information, page metadata etc. The rationale for analytics tags is to provide data from the user's browser DOM to the vendor for some form of marketing analysis. This data can be anything available in the DOM. The data is used for user navigation and clickstream analysis, identification of the user to determine further content to display etc., and various marketing analysis functions.</p>
<p>The term <strong>host</strong> refers to the original site the user goes to, such as a shopping or news site, that contains or retrieves and executes third party JavaScript tag for marketing analysis of the user actions.</p>
<h2>Major risks</h2>
<p>The single greatest risk is a compromise of the third party JavaScript server, and the injection of malicious JavaScript into the original tag JavaScript. This has happened in 2018 and likely earlier.</p>
<p>The invocation of third-party JS code in a web application requires consideration for 3 risks in particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>The loss of control over changes to the client application,</li>
<li>The execution of arbitrary code on client systems,</li>
<li>The disclosure or leakage of sensitive information to 3rd parties.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Risk 1: Loss of control over changes to the client application</h3>
<p>This risk arises from the fact that there is usually no guaranty that the code hosted at the third-party will remain the same as seen from the developers and testers: new features may be pushed in the third-party code at any time, thus potentially breaking the interface or data-flows and exposing the availability of your application to its users/customers.</p>
<p>Typical defenses include, but are not restricted to: in-house script mirroring (to prevent alterations by 3rd parties), sub-resource integrity (to enable browser-level interception) and secure transmission of the third-party code (to prevent modifications while in-transit). See below for more details.</p>
<h3>Risk 2: Execution of arbitrary code on client systems</h3>
<p>This risk arises from the fact that third-party JavaScript code is rarely reviewed by the invoking party prior to its integration into a website/application. As the client reaches the hosting website/application, this third-party code gets executed, thus granting the third-party the exact same privileges that were granted to the user (similar to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS attacks</a>).</p>
<p>Any testing performed prior to entering production loses some of its validity, including <code>AST testing</code> (<a href="https://www.veracode.com/security/interactive-application-security-testing-iast">IAST</a>, <a href="https://www.veracode.com/sites/default/files/pdf/resources/whitepapers/what-is-rasp.pdf">RAST</a>, <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/web-application-security/what-is-sast">SAST</a>, <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/web-application-security/what-is-dast">DAST</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>While it is widely accepted that the probability of having rogue code intentionally injected by the third-party is low, there are still cases of malicious injections in third-party code after the organization's servers were compromised (ex: Yahoo, January 2014).</p>
<p>This risk should therefore still be evaluated, in particular when the third-party does not show any documentation that it is enforcing better security measures than the invoking organization itself, or at least equivalent. Another example is that the domain hosting the third-party JavaScript code expires because the company maintaining it is bankrupt or the developers have abandoned the project. A malicious actor can then re-register the domain and publish malicious code.</p>
<p>Typical defenses include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-house script mirroring (to prevent alterations by 3rd parties),</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Sub-resource integrity</a> (to enable browser-level interception),</li>
<li>Secure transmission of the third-party code (to prevent modifications while in-transit) and various types of sandboxing. See below for more details.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk 3: Disclosure of sensitive information to 3rd parties</h3>
<p>When a third-party script is invoked in a website/application, the browser directly contacts the third-party servers. By default, the request includes all regular HTTP headers. In addition to the originating IP address of the browser, the third-party also obtains other data such as the referrer (in non-https requests) and any cookies previously set by the 3rd party, for example when visiting another organization's website that also invokes the third-party script.</p>
<p>In many cases, this grants the third-party primary access to information on the organization's users / customers / clients. Additionally, if the third-party is sharing the script with other entities, it also collects secondary data from all the other entities, thus knowing who the organization's visitors are but also what other organizations they interact with.</p>
<p>A typical case is the current situation with major news/press sites that invoke third-party code (typically for ad engines, statistics and JavaScript APIs): any user visiting any of these websites also informs the 3rd parties of the visit. In many cases, the third-party also gets to know what news articles each individual user is clicking specifically (leakage occurs through the HTTP referrer field) and thus can establish deeper personality profiles.</p>
<p>Typical defenses include, but are not restricted to: in-house script mirroring (to prevent leakage of HTTP requests to 3rd parties). Users can reduce their profiling by random clicking links on leaking websites/applications (such as press/news websites) to reduce profiling. See below for more details.</p>
<h2>Third-party JavaScript Deployment Architectures</h2>
<p>There are three basic deployment mechanisms for <strong>tags</strong>. These mechanisms can be combined with each other.</p>
<h3>Vendor JavaScript on page</h3>
<p>This is where the vendor provides the host with the JavaScript and the host puts it on the host page. To be secure the host company must review the code for any vulnerabilities like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS attacks</a> or malicious actions such as sending sensitive data from the DOM to a malicious site. This is often difficult because the JavaScript is commonly obfuscated.</p>
<p><code>html
&lt;!-- Some host, e.g. foobar.com, HTML code here --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        ...
        &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;/* 3rd party vendor javascript here */&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
<h3>JavaScript Request to Vendor</h3>
<p>This is where one or a few lines of code on the host page each request a JavaScript file or URL directly from the vendor site. When the host page is being created, the developer includes the lines of code provided by the vendor that will request the vendor JavaScript. Each time the page is accessed the requests are made to the vendor site for the javascript, which then executes on the user browser.</p>
<p><code>html
&lt;!-- Some host, e.g. foobar.com, HTML code here --&gt;`
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        ...
        &lt;!-- 3rd party vendor javascript --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://analytics.vendor.com/v1.1/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;!-- /3rd party vendor javascript --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
<h3>Indirect request to Vendor through Tag Manager</h3>
<p>This is where one or a few lines of code on the host page each request a JavaScript file or URL from a tag aggregator or <strong>tag manager</strong> site; not from the JavaScript vendor site. The tag aggregator or tag manager site returns whatever third party JavaScript files that the host company has configured to be returned. Each file or URL request to the tag manager site can return lots of other JavaScript files from multiple vendors.</p>
<p>The actual content that is returned from the aggregator or manager (i.e. the specific JavaScript files as well as exactly what they do) can be dynamically changed by host site employees using a graphical user interface for development, hosted on the tag manager site that non-technical users can work with, such as the marketing part of the business.</p>
<p>The changes can be either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a different JavaScript file from the third-party vendor for the same request.</li>
<li>Change what DOM object data is read, and when, to send to the vendor.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tag manager developer user interface will generate code that does what the marketing functionality requires, basically determining what data to get from the browser DOM and when to get it. The tag manager always returns a <strong>container</strong> JavaScript file to the browser which is basically a set of JavaScript functions that are used by the code generated by the user interface to implement the required functionality.</p>
<p>Similar to java frameworks that provide functions and global data to the developer, the container JavaScript executes on the browser and lets the business user use the tag manager developer user interface to specify high level functionality without needing to know JavaScript.</p>

<h4>Security Problems with requesting Tags</h4>
<p>The previously described mechanisms are difficult to make secure because you can only see the code if you proxy the requests or if you get access to the GUI and see what is configured. The JavaScript is generally obfuscated so even seeing it is usually not useful. It is also instantly deployable because each new page request from a browser executes the requests to the aggregator which gets the JavaScript from the third party vendor. So as soon as any JavaScript files are changed on the vendor, or modified on the aggregator, the next call for them from any browser will get the changed JavaScript. One way to manage this risk is with the <em>Subresource Integrity</em> standard described below.</p>
<h3>Server Direct Data Layer</h3>
<p>The tag manager developer user interface can be used to create JavaScript that can get data from anywhere in the browser DOM and store it anywhere on the page. This can allow vulnerabilities because the interface can be used to generate code to get unvalidated data from the DOM (e.g. URL parameters) and store it in some page location that would execute JavaScript.</p>
<p>The best way to make the generated code secure is to confine it to getting DOM data from a host defined data layer.</p>
<p>The data layer is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>a DIV object with attribute values that have the marketing or user behavior data that the third-party wants</li>
<li>a set of JSON objects with the same data. Each variable or attribute contains the value of some DOM element or the description of a user action. The data layer is the complete set of values that all vendors need for that page. The data layer is created by the host developers.</li>
</ol>
<p>When specific events happen that the business has defined, a JavaScript handler for that event sends values from the data layer directly to the tag manager server. The tag manager server then sends the data to whatever third party or parties is supposed to get it. The event handler code is created by the host developers using the tag manager developer user interface. The event handler code is loaded from the tag manager servers on every page load.</p>
<p><strong>This is a secure technique</strong> because only your JavaScript executes on your users browser, and only the data you decide on is sent to the vendor.</p>
<p>This requires cooperation between the host, the aggregator or tag manager and the vendors.</p>
<p>The host developers have to work with the vendor in order to know what type of data the vendor needs to do their analysis. Then the host programmer determines what DOM element will have that data.</p>
<p>The host developers have to work with the tag manager or aggregator to agree on the protocol to send the data to the aggregator: what URL, parameters, format etc.</p>
<p>The tag manager or aggregator has to work with the vendor to agree on the protocol to send the data to the vendor: what URL, parameters, format etc. Does the vendor have an API?</p>
<h2>Security Defense Considerations</h2>
<h3>Server Direct Data Layer</h3>
<p>The server direct mechanism is a good security standard for third party JavaScript management, deployment and execution. A good practice for the host page is to create a data layer of DOM objects.</p>
<p>The data layer can perform any validation of the values, especially values from DOM objects exposed to the user like URL parameters and input fields, if these are required for the marketing analysis.</p>
<p>An example statement for a corporate standard document is 'The tag JavaScript can only access values in the host data layer. The tag JavaScript can never access a URL parameter.</p>
<p>You the host page developer have to agree with the third-party vendors or the tag manager what attribute in the data layer will have what value so they can create the JavaScript to read that value.</p>
<p>User interface tags cannot be made secure using the data layer architecture because their function (or one of their functions) is to change the user interface on the client, not to send data about the user actions.</p>
<p>Analytics tags can be made secure using the data layer architecture because the only action needed is to send data from the data layer to the third party. Only first party code is executed; first to populate the data layer (generally on page load); then event handler JavaScript sends whatever data is needed from that page to the third party database or tag manager.</p>
<p>This is also a very scalable solution. Large ecommerce sites can easily have hundreds of thousands of URL and parameter combinations, with different sets of URLs and parameters being included in different marketing analysis campaigns. The marketing logic could have 30 or 40 different vendor tags on a single page.</p>
<p>For example user actions in pages about specified cities, from specified locations on specified days should send data layer elements 1, 2 and 3. User actions in pages about other cities should send data layer elements 2 and 3 only. Since the event handler code to send data layer data on each page is controlled by the host developers or marketing technologists using the tag manager developer interface, the business logic about when and what data layer elements are sent to the tag manager server, can be changed and deployed in minutes. No interaction is needed with the third parties; they continue getting the data they expect but now it comes from different contexts that the host marketing technologists have chosen.</p>
<p>Changing third party vendors just means changing the data dissemination rules at the tag manager server, no changes are needed in the host code. The data also goes directly only to the tag manager so the execution is fast. The event handler JavaScript does not have to connect to multiple third party sites.</p>
<h3>Indirect Requests</h3>
<p>For indirect requests to tag manager/aggregator sites that offer the GUI to configure the javascript, they may also implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical controls such as only allowing the JavaScript to access the data layer values, no other DOM element</li>
<li>Restricting the tag types deployed on a host site, e.g. disabling of custom HTML tags and JavaScript code</li>
</ul>
<p>The host company should also verify the security practices of the tag manager site such as access controls to the tag configuration for the host company. It also can be two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Letting the marketing folks decide where to get the data they want can result in XSS because they may get it from a URL parameter and put it into a variable that is in a scriptable location on the page.</p>
<h3>Sandboxing Content</h3>
<p>Both of these tools be used by sites to sandbox/clean DOM data.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a> is a fast, tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. DOMPurify works with a secure default, but offers a lot of configurability and hooks.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hackvertor/MentalJS">MentalJS</a> is a JavaScript parser and sandbox. It allow-lists JavaScript code by adding a "$" suffix to variables and accessors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subresource Integrity</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">Subresource Integrity</a> will ensure that only the code that has been reviewed is executed. The developer generates integrity metadata for the vendor javascript, and adds it to the script element like this:</p>
<p><code>javascript
&lt;script src="https://analytics.vendor.com/v1.1/script.js"
   integrity="sha384-MBO5IDfYaE6c6Aao94oZrIOiC7CGiSNE64QUbHNPhzk8Xhm0djE6QqTpL0HzTUxk"
   crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>It is important to know that in order for SRI to work, the vendor host needs <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a> enabled. Also it is good idea to monitor vendor JavaScript for changes in regular way. Because sometimes you can get <strong>secure</strong> but <strong>not working</strong> third-party code when the vendor decides to update it.</p>
<h3>Keeping JavaScript libraries updated</h3>
<p><a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">OWASP Top 10 2013 A9</a> describes the problem of using components with known vulnerabilities. This includes JavaScript libraries. JavaScript libraries must be kept up to date, as previous version can have known vulnerabilities which can lead to the site typically being vulnerable to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting</a>. There are several tools out there that can help identify such libraries. One such tool is the free open source tool <a href="https://retirejs.github.io">RetireJS</a></p>
<h3>Sandboxing with iframe</h3>
<p>You can also put vendor JavaScript into an iframe from different domain (e.g. static data host). It will work as a "jail" and vendor JavaScript will not have direct access to the host page DOM and cookies.</p>
<p>The host main page and sandbox iframe can communicate between each other via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">postMessage mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>Also, iframes can be secured with the iframe <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/">sandbox attribute</a>.</p>
<p>For high risk applications, consider the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> in addition to iframe sandboxing. CSP makes hardening against XSS even stronger.</p>

<h3>Virtual iframe Containment</h3>
<p>This technique creates iFrames that run asynchronously in relation to the main page. It also provides its own containment JavaScript that automates the dynamic implementation of the protected iFrames based on the marketing tag requirements.</p>
<h3>Vendor Agreements</h3>
<p>You can have the agreement or request for proposal with the 3rd parties require evidence that they have implemented secure coding and general corporate server access security. But in particular you need to determine the monitoring and control of their source code in order to prevent and detect malicious changes to that JavaScript.</p>
<h2>MarTechSec</h2>
<p>Marketing Technology Security</p>
<p>This refers to all aspects of reducing the risk from marketing JavaScript. Controls include</p>
<ol>
<li>Contractual controls for risk reduction; the contracts with any MarTech company should include a requirement to show evidence of code security and code integrity monitoring.</li>
<li>Contractual controls for risk transference: the contracts with any MarTech company could include a penalty for serving malicious JavaScript</li>
<li>Technical controls for malicious JavaScript execution prevention; Virtual Iframes,</li>
<li>Technical controls for malicious JavaScript identification; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a>.</li>
<li>Technical controls including client side JavaScript malicious behavior in penetration testing requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h2>MarSecOps</h2>
<p>Marketing Security Operations</p>
<p>This refers to the operational requirements to maintain some of the technical controls. This involves possible cooperation and information exchange between the marketing team, the martech provider and the run or operations team to update the information in the page controls (SRI hash change, changes in pages with SRI), the policies in the Virtual iFrames, tag manager configuration, data layer changes etc.</p>
<p>The most complete and preventive controls for any site containing non-trivial marketing tags are -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A data layer that calls the marketing server or tag manager APIs , so that only your code executes on your page (inversion of control).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual frame Containment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The MarSecOps requirements to implement technical controls at the speed of change that marketing wants or without a significant number of dedicated resources, can make data layer and Subresource Integrity controls impractical.</p>

<h1>Password Storage</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. The majority of modern languages and frameworks provide built-in functionality to help store passwords safely.</p>
<p>After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline. As a defender, it is only possible to slow down offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible.</p>
<p>This cheat sheet provides guidance on the various areas that need to be considered related to storing passwords. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use <a href="#argon2id">Argon2id</a> with a minimum configuration of 15 MiB of memory, an iteration count of 2, and 1 degree of parallelism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If <a href="#argon2id">Argon2id</a> is not available, use <a href="#scrypt">scrypt</a> with a minimum CPU/memory cost parameter of (2^16), a minimum block size of 8 (1024 bytes), and a parallelization parameter of 1.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For legacy systems using <a href="#bcrypt">bcrypt</a>, use a work factor of 10 or more and with a password limit of 72 bytes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If FIPS-140 compliance is required, use <a href="#pbkdf2">PBKDF2</a> with a work factor of 310,000 or more and set with an internal hash function of HMAC-SHA-256.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider using a <a href="#peppering">pepper</a> to provide additional defense in depth (though alone, it provides no additional secure characteristics).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Hashing vs Encryption</h3>
<p>Hashing and encryption both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe. However, in almost all circumstances, <strong>passwords should be hashed, NOT encrypted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hashing is a one-way function</strong> (i.e., it is impossible to "decrypt" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value). Hashing is appropriate for password validation. Even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption is a two-way function</strong>, meaning that the original plaintext can be retrieved. Encryption is appropriate for storing data such as a user's address since this data is displayed in plaintext on the user's profile. Hashing their address would result in a garbled mess.</p>
<p>In the context of password storage, encryption should only be used in edge cases where it is necessary to obtain the original plaintext password. This might be necessary if the application needs to use the password to authenticate with another system that does not support a modern way to programmatically grant access, such as OpenID Connect (OIDC). Where possible, an alternative architecture should be used to avoid the need to store passwords in an encrypted form.</p>
<p>For further guidance on encryption, see the <a href="Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.md">Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<h3>How Attackers Crack Password Hashes</h3>
<p>Although it is not possible to "decrypt" password hashes to obtain the original passwords, it is possible to "crack" the hashes in some circumstances.</p>
<p>The basic steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a password you think the victim has chosen (e.g.<code>password1!</code>)</li>
<li>Calculate the hash</li>
<li>Compare the hash you calculated to the hash of the victim. If they match, you have correctly "cracked" the hash and now know the plaintext value of their password.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is repeated for a large number of potential candidate passwords. Different methods can be used to select candidate passwords, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites</li>
<li>Brute force (trying every possible candidate)</li>
<li>Dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords</li>
</ul>
<p>While the number of permutations can be enormous, with high speed hardware (such as GPUs) and cloud services with many servers for rent, the cost to an attacker is relatively small to do successful password cracking especially when best practices for hashing are not followed.</p>
<p><strong>Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack.</strong>  It is your responsibility as an application owner to select a modern hashing algorithm.</p>
<h2>Password Storage Concepts</h2>
<h3>Salting</h3>
<p>A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. As the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes.</p>
<p>Salting also protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Finally, salting means that it is impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes, as the different salts will result in different hashes even if the passwords are the same.</p>
<p><a href="#password-hashing-algorithms">Modern hashing algorithms</a> such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords, so no additional steps are required when using them.</p>
<h3>Peppering</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-kitten-password-storage-04.html#section-4.2">pepper</a> can be used in addition to salting to provide an additional layer of protection. The purpose of the pepper is to prevent an attacker from being able to crack any of the hashes if they only have access to the database, for example, if they have exploited a SQL injection vulnerability or obtained a backup of the database.</p>
<p>One of several peppering strategies is to hash the passwords as usual (using a password hashing algorithm) and then HMAC or encrypt the hashes with a symmetrical encryption key before storing the password hash in the database, with the key acting as the pepper. Peppering strategies do not affect the password hashing function in any way.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pepper is <strong>shared between stored passwords</strong>, rather than being <em>unique</em> like a salt.</li>
<li>Unlike a password salt, the pepper <strong>should not be stored in the database</strong>.</li>
<li>Peppers are secrets and should be stored in "secrets vaults" or HSMs (Hardware Security Modules).</li>
<li>Like any other cryptographic key, a pepper rotation strategy should be considered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work Factors</h3>
<p>The work factor is essentially the number of iterations of the hashing algorithm that are performed for each password (usually, it's actually <code>2^work</code> iterations). The purpose of the work factor is to make calculating the hash more computationally expensive, which in turn reduces the speed and/or increases the cost for which an attacker can attempt to crack the password hash. The work factor is typically stored in the hash output.</p>
<p>When choosing a work factor, a balance needs to be struck between security and performance. Higher work factors will make the hashes more difficult for an attacker to crack but will also make the process of verifying a login attempt slower. If the work factor is too high, this may degrade the performance of the application and could also be used by an attacker to carry out a denial of service attack by making a large number of login attempts to exhaust the server's CPU.</p>
<p>There is no golden rule for the ideal work factor - it will depend on the performance of the server and the number of users on the application. Determining the optimal work factor will require experimentation on the specific server(s) used by the application. As a general rule, calculating a hash should take less than one second.</p>
<h4>Upgrading the Work Factor</h4>
<p>One key advantage of having a work factor is that it can be increased over time as hardware becomes more powerful and cheaper.</p>
<p>The most common approach to upgrading the work factor is to wait until the user next authenticates and then to re-hash their password with the new work factor. This means that different hashes will have different work factors and may result in hashes never being upgraded if the user doesn't log back into the application. Depending on the application, it may be appropriate to remove the older password hashes and require users to reset their passwords next time they need to login in order to avoid storing older and less secure hashes.</p>
<h2>Password Hashing Algorithms</h2>
<p>There are a number of modern hashing algorithms that have been specifically designed for securely storing passwords. This means that they should be slow (unlike algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1, which were designed to be fast), and how slow they are can be configured by changing the <a href="#work-factors">work factor</a>.</p>
<p>Websites should not hide which password hashing algorithm they use. If you utilize a modern password hashing algorithm with proper configuration parameters, it should be safe to state in public which password hashing algorithms are in use and be listed <a href="https://pulse.michalspacek.cz/passwords/storages">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main three algorithms that should be considered are listed below:</p>
<h3>Argon2id</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> is the winner of the 2015 <a href="https://password-hashing.net">Password Hashing Competition</a>. There are three different versions of the algorithm, and the Argon2id variant should be used, as it provides a balanced approach to resisting both side-channel and GPU-based attacks.</p>
<p>Rather than a simple work factor like other algorithms, Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured. Argon2id should use one of the following configuration settings as a base minimum which includes the minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the degree of parallelism (p).</p>
<ul>
<li>m=37 MiB, t=1, p=1</li>
<li>m=15 MiB, t=2, p=1</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these configuration settings are equivalent in the defense they provide. The only difference is a trade off between CPU and RAM usage.</p>
<h3>scrypt</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf">scrypt</a> is a password-based key derivation function created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cperciva">Colin Percival</a>. While new systems should consider <a href="#argon2id">Argon2id</a> for password hashing, scrypt should be configured properly when used in legacy systems.</p>
<p>Like <a href="#argon2id">Argon2id</a>, scrypt has three different parameters that can be configured. scrypt should use one of the following configuration settings as a base minimum which includes the minimum CPU/memory cost parameter (N), the blocksize (r) and the degree of parallelism (p).</p>
<ul>
<li>N=2^16 (64 MiB), r=8 (1024 bytes), p=1</li>
<li>N=2^15 (32 MiB), r=8 (1024 bytes), p=2</li>
<li>N=2^14 (16 MiB), r=8 (1024 bytes), p=4</li>
<li>N=2^13 (8 MiB), r=8 (1024 bytes), p=8</li>
<li>N=2^12 (4 MiB), r=8 (1024 bytes), p=15</li>
</ul>
<p>These configuration settings are equivalent in the defense they provide. The only difference is a trade off between CPU and RAM usage.</p>
<h3>bcrypt</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bcrypt">bcrypt</a> password hashing function should be the second choice for password storage if Argon2id is not available or PBKDF2 is required to achieve FIPS-140 compliance.</p>
<p>The minimum work factor for bcrypt should be 10.</p>
<h4>Input Limits</h4>
<p>bcrypt has a maximum length input length of 72 bytes <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/39849/does-bcrypt-have-a-maximum-password-length">for most implementations</a>. To protect against this issue, a maximum password length of 72 bytes (or less if the implementation in use has smaller limits) should be enforced when using bcrypt.</p>
<h4>Pre-Hashing Passwords</h4>
<p>An alternative approach is to pre-hash the user-supplied password with a fast algorithm such as SHA-256, and then to hash the resulting hash with bcrypt (i.e., <code>bcrypt(base64(hmac-sha256(data:$password, key:$pepper)), $salt, $cost)</code>). This is a dangerous (but common) practice that <strong>should be avoided</strong> due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQD3qDYMyYQ">password shucking</a> and other issues when <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2015/03/security-issue-combining-bcrypt-with.html">combining bcrypt with other hash functions</a>.</p>
<h3>PBKDF2</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> is recommended by <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver">NIST</a> and has FIPS-140 validated implementations. So, it should be the preferred algorithm when these are required.</p>
<p>PBKDF2 requires that you select an internal hashing algorithm such as an HMAC or a variety of other hashing algorithms. HMAC-SHA-256 is widely supported and is recommended by NIST.</p>
<p>The work factor for PBKDF2 is implemented through an iteration count, which should set differently based on the internal hashing algorithm used.</p>
<ul>
<li>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1: 720,000 iterations</li>
<li>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: 310,000 iterations</li>
<li>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512: 120,000 iterations</li>
</ul>
<p>These configuration settings are equivalent in the defense they provide.</p>
<p>When PBKDF2 is used with an HMAC, and the password is longer than the hash function's block size (64 bytes for SHA-256), the password will be automatically pre-hashed. For example, the password "This is a password longer than 512 bits which is the block size of SHA-256" is converted to the hash value (in hex) fa91498c139805af73f7ba275cca071e78d78675027000c99a9925e2ec92eedd. A good implementation of PBKDF2 will perform this step before the expensive iterated hashing phase, but some implementations perform the conversion on each iteration. This can make hashing long passwords significantly more expensive than hashing short passwords. If a user can supply very long passwords, there is a potential denial of service vulnerability, such as the one published in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/15/security/">Django</a> in 2013. Manual <a href="#pre-hashing-passwords">pre-hashing</a> can reduce this risk but requires adding a <a href="#salting">salt</a> to the pre-hash step.</p>
<h2>Upgrading Legacy Hashes</h2>
<p>For older applications built using less secure hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA-1, these hashes should be upgraded to modern password hashing algorithms as described above. When the user next enters their password (usually by authenticating on the application), it should be re-hashed using the new algorithm. It would also be good practice to expire the users' current password and require them to enter a new one so that any older (less secure) hashes of their password are no longer useful to an attacker.</p>
<p>However, this approach means that old (less secure) password hashes will be stored in the database until the user logs in. Two main approaches can be taken to avoid this dilemma.</p>
<p>One method is to expire and delete the password hashes of users who have been inactive for an extended period and require them to reset their passwords to login again. Although secure, this approach is not particularly user-friendly. Expiring the passwords of many users may cause issues for support staff or may be interpreted by users as an indication of a breach.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to use the existing password hashes as inputs for a more secure algorithm. For example, if the application originally stored passwords as <code>md5($password)</code>, this could be easily upgraded to <code>bcrypt(md5($password))</code>. Layering the hashes avoids the need to know the original password; however, it can make the hashes easier to crack. These hashes should be replaced with direct hashes of the users' passwords next time the user logs in.</p>
<p>Assume that whatever password hashing method is selected will have to be upgraded in the future. Ensure that upgrading your hashing algorithm is as easy as possible. For a transition period, allow for a mix of old and new hashing algorithms. Using a mix of hashing algorithms is easier if the password hashing algorithm and work factor are stored with the password using a standard format, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md">modular PHC string format</a>.</p>
<h3>International Characters</h3>
<p>Ensure your hashing library is able to accept a wide range of characters and is compatible with all Unicode codepoints. Users should be able to use the full range of characters available on modern devices, in particular mobile keyboards. They should be able to select passwords from various languages and include pictograms. Prior to hashing the entropy of the user's entry should not be reduced. Password hashing libraries need to be able to use input that may contain a NULL byte.</p>
<h1>Session Management</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Web Authentication, Session Management, and Access Control</strong>:</p>
<p>A web session is a sequence of network HTTP request and response transactions associated with the same user. Modern and complex web applications require the retaining of information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. Therefore, sessions provide the ability to establish variables – such as access rights and localization settings – which will apply to each and every interaction a user has with the web application for the duration of the session.</p>
<p>Web applications can create sessions to keep track of anonymous users after the very first user request. An example would be maintaining the user language preference. Additionally, web applications will make use of sessions once the user has authenticated. This ensures the ability to identify the user on any subsequent requests as well as being able to apply security access controls, authorized access to the user private data, and to increase the usability of the application. Therefore, current web applications can provide session capabilities both pre and post authentication.</p>
<p>Once an authenticated session has been established, the session ID (or token) is temporarily equivalent to the strongest authentication method used by the application, such as username and password, passphrases, one-time passwords (OTP), client-based digital certificates, smartcards, or biometrics (such as fingerprint or eye retina). See the OWASP <a href="Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md">Authentication Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a> section 5), where each request and response pair is independent of other web interactions. Therefore, in order to introduce the concept of a session, it is required to implement session management capabilities that link both the authentication and access control (or authorization) modules commonly available in web applications:</p>
<p><img alt="SessionDiagram" src="../assets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet_Diagram.png" /></p>
<p>The session ID or token binds the user authentication credentials (in the form of a user session) to the user HTTP traffic and the appropriate access controls enforced by the web application. The complexity of these three components (authentication, session management, and access control) in modern web applications, plus the fact that its implementation and binding resides on the web developer's hands (as web development frameworks do not provide strict relationships between these modules), makes the implementation of a secure session management module very challenging.</p>
<p>The disclosure, capture, prediction, brute force, or fixation of the session ID will lead to session hijacking (or sidejacking) attacks, where an attacker is able to fully impersonate a victim user in the web application. Attackers can perform two types of session hijacking attacks, targeted or generic. In a targeted attack, the attacker's goal is to impersonate a specific (or privileged) web application victim user. For generic attacks, the attacker's goal is to impersonate (or get access as) any valid or legitimate user in the web application.</p>
<h2>Session ID Properties</h2>
<p>In order to keep the authenticated state and track the users progress within the web application, applications provide users with a <strong>session identifier</strong> (session ID or token) that is assigned at session creation time, and is shared and exchanged by the user and the web application for the duration of the session (it is sent on every HTTP request). The session ID is a <code>name=value</code> pair.</p>
<p>With the goal of implementing secure session IDs, the generation of identifiers (IDs or tokens) must meet the following properties.</p>
<h3>Session ID Name Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>The name used by the session ID should not be extremely descriptive nor offer unnecessary details about the purpose and meaning of the ID.</p>
<p>The session ID names used by the most common web application development frameworks <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Cookies_Database">can be easily fingerprinted</a>, such as <code>PHPSESSID</code> (PHP), <code>JSESSIONID</code> (J2EE), <code>CFID</code> &amp; <code>CFTOKEN</code> (ColdFusion), <code>ASP.NET_SessionId</code> (ASP .NET), etc. Therefore, the session ID name can disclose the technologies and programming languages used by the web application.</p>
<p>It is recommended to change the default session ID name of the web development framework to a generic name, such as <code>id</code>.</p>
<h3>Session ID Length</h3>
<p>The session ID must be long enough to prevent brute force attacks, where an attacker can go through the whole range of ID values and verify the existence of valid sessions.</p>
<p>The session ID length must be at least <code>128 bits (16 bytes)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The session ID length of 128 bits is provided as a reference based on the assumptions made on the next section <em>Session ID Entropy</em>. However, this number should not be considered as an absolute minimum value, as other implementation factors might influence its strength.</li>
<li>For example, there are well-known implementations, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.sessionstate.sessionidmanager?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.7.2">Microsoft ASP.NET session IDs</a>: "<em>The ASP .NET session identifier is a randomly generated number encoded into a 24-character string consisting of lowercase characters from a to z and numbers from 0 to 5</em>".</li>
<li>It can provide a very good effective entropy, and as a result, can be considered long enough to avoid guessing or brute force attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session ID Entropy</h3>
<p>The session ID must be unpredictable (random enough) to prevent guessing attacks, where an attacker is able to guess or predict the ID of a valid session through statistical analysis techniques. For this purpose, a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">CSPRNG</a> (Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator) must be used.</p>
<p>The session ID value must provide at least <code>64 bits</code> of entropy (if a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">PRNG</a> is used, this value is estimated to be half the length of the session ID).</p>
<p>Additionally, a random session ID is not enough; it must also be unique to avoid duplicated IDs. A random session ID must not already exist in the current session ID space.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The session ID entropy is really affected by other external and difficult to measure factors, such as the number of concurrent active sessions the web application commonly has, the absolute session expiration timeout, the amount of session ID guesses per second the attacker can make and the target web application can support, etc.</li>
<li>If a session ID with an entropy of <code>64 bits</code> is used, it will take an attacker at least 292 years to successfully guess a valid session ID, assuming the attacker can try 10,000 guesses per second with 100,000 valid simultaneous sessions available in the web application.</li>
<li>More information <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insufficient_Session-ID_Length">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session ID Content (or Value)</h3>
<p>The session ID content (or value) must be meaningless to prevent information disclosure attacks, where an attacker is able to decode the contents of the ID and extract details of the user, the session, or the inner workings of the web application.</p>
<p>The session ID must simply be an identifier on the client side, and its value must never include sensitive information (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">PII</a>).</p>
<p>The meaning and business or application logic associated with the session ID must be stored on the server side, and specifically, in session objects or in a session management database or repository.</p>
<p>The stored information can include the client IP address, User-Agent, e-mail, username, user ID, role, privilege level, access rights, language preferences, account ID, current state, last login, session timeouts, and other internal session details. If the session objects and properties contain sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, it is required to duly encrypt and protect the session management repository.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the session ID created by your language or framework. If you need to create your own sessionID, use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) with a size of at least 128 bits and ensure that each sessionID is unique.</p>
<h2>Session Management Implementation</h2>
<p>The session management implementation defines the exchange mechanism that will be used between the user and the web application to share and continuously exchange the session ID. There are multiple mechanisms available in HTTP to maintain session state within web applications, such as cookies (standard HTTP header), URL parameters (URL rewriting – <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC2396</a>), URL arguments on GET requests, body arguments on POST requests, such as hidden form fields (HTML forms), or proprietary HTTP headers.</p>
<p>The preferred session ID exchange mechanism should allow defining advanced token properties, such as the token expiration date and time, or granular usage constraints. This is one of the reasons why cookies (RFCs <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt">2109</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt">2965</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt">6265</a>) are one of the most extensively used session ID exchange mechanisms, offering advanced capabilities not available in other methods.</p>
<p>The usage of specific session ID exchange mechanisms, such as those where the ID is included in the URL, might disclose the session ID (in web links and logs, web browser history and bookmarks, the Referer header or search engines), as well as facilitate other attacks, such as the manipulation of the ID or <a href="http://www.acrossecurity.com/papers/session_fixation.pdf">session fixation attacks</a>.</p>
<h3>Built-in Session Management Implementations</h3>
<p>Web development frameworks, such as J2EE, ASP .NET, PHP, and others, provide their own session management features and associated implementation. It is recommended to use these built-in frameworks versus building a home made one from scratch, as they are used worldwide on multiple web environments and have been tested by the web application security and development communities over time.</p>
<p>However, be advised that these frameworks have also presented vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the past, so it is always recommended to use the latest version available, that potentially fixes all the well-known vulnerabilities, as well as review and change the default configuration to enhance its security by following the recommendations described along this document.</p>
<p>The storage capabilities or repository used by the session management mechanism to temporarily save the session IDs must be secure, protecting the session IDs against local or remote accidental disclosure or unauthorized access.</p>
<h3>Used vs. Accepted Session ID Exchange Mechanisms</h3>
<p>A web application should make use of cookies for session ID exchange management. If a user submits a session ID through a different exchange mechanism, such as a URL parameter, the web application should avoid accepting it as part of a defensive strategy to stop session fixation.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if a web application makes use of cookies as its default session ID exchange mechanism, it might accept other exchange mechanisms too.</li>
<li>It is therefore required to confirm via thorough testing all the different mechanisms currently accepted by the web application when processing and managing session IDs, and limit the accepted session ID tracking mechanisms to just cookies.</li>
<li>In the past, some web applications used URL parameters, or even switched from cookies to URL parameters (via automatic URL rewriting), if certain conditions are met (for example, the identification of web clients without support for cookies or not accepting cookies due to user privacy concerns).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transport Layer Security</h3>
<p>In order to protect the session ID exchange from active eavesdropping and passive disclosure in the network traffic, it is essential to use an encrypted HTTPS (TLS) connection for the entire web session, not only for the authentication process where the user credentials are exchanged. This may be mitigated by <a href="HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> for a client that supports it.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>Secure</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies">cookie attribute</a> must be used to ensure the session ID is only exchanged through an encrypted channel. The usage of an encrypted communication channel also protects the session against some session fixation attacks where the attacker is able to intercept and manipulate the web traffic to inject (or fix) the session ID on the victim's web browser (see <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-Slides.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-WP.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>The following set of best practices are focused on protecting the session ID (specifically when cookies are used) and helping with the integration of HTTPS within the web application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not switch a given session from HTTP to HTTPS, or vice-versa, as this will disclose the session ID in the clear through the network.<ul>
<li>When redirecting to HTTPS, ensure that the cookie is set or regenerated <strong>after</strong> the redirect has occurred.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not mix encrypted and unencrypted contents (HTML pages, images, CSS, JavaScript files, etc) in the same page, or from the same domain.</li>
<li>Where possible, avoid offering public unencrypted contents and private encrypted contents from the same host. Where insecure content is required, consider hosting this on a separate insecure domain.</li>
<li>Implement <a href="HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> to enforce HTTPS connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the OWASP <a href="Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.md">Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet</a> for more general guidance on implementing TLS securely.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that TLS does not protect against session ID prediction, brute force, client-side tampering or fixation; however, it does provide effective protection against an attacker intercepting or stealing session IDs through a man in the middle attack.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The session ID exchange mechanism based on cookies provides multiple security features in the form of cookie attributes that can be used to protect the exchange of the session ID:</p>
<h3>Secure Attribute</h3>
<p>The <code>Secure</code> cookie attribute instructs web browsers to only send the cookie through an encrypted HTTPS (SSL/TLS) connection. This session protection mechanism is mandatory to prevent the disclosure of the session ID through MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. It ensures that an attacker cannot simply capture the session ID from web browser traffic.</p>
<p>Forcing the web application to only use HTTPS for its communication (even when port TCP/80, HTTP, is closed in the web application host) does not protect against session ID disclosure if the <code>Secure</code> cookie has not been set - the web browser can be deceived to disclose the session ID over an unencrypted HTTP connection. The attacker can intercept and manipulate the victim user traffic and inject an HTTP unencrypted reference to the web application that will force the web browser to submit the session ID in the clear.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies">SecureFlag</a></p>
<h3>HttpOnly Attribute</h3>
<p>The <code>HttpOnly</code> cookie attribute instructs web browsers not to allow scripts (e.g. JavaScript or VBscript) an ability to access the cookies via the DOM document.cookie object. This session ID protection is mandatory to prevent session ID stealing through XSS attacks. However, if an XSS attack is combined with a CSRF attack, the requests sent to the web application will include the session cookie, as the browser always includes the cookies when sending requests. The <code>HttpOnly</code> cookie only protects the confidentiality of the cookie; the attacker cannot use it offline, outside of the context of an XSS attack.</p>
<p>See the OWASP <a href="Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies">HttpOnly</a></p>
<h3>SameSite Attribute</h3>
<p>SameSite defines a cookie attribute preventing browsers from sending a SameSite flagged cookie with cross-site requests. The main goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage, and provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies">SameSite</a></p>
<h3>Domain and Path Attributes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Directives"><code>Domain</code> cookie attribute</a> instructs web browsers to only send the cookie to the specified domain and all subdomains. If the attribute is not set, by default the cookie will only be sent to the origin server. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Directives"><code>Path</code> cookie attribute</a> instructs web browsers to only send the cookie to the specified directory or subdirectories (or paths or resources) within the web application. If the attribute is not set, by default the cookie will only be sent for the directory (or path) of the resource requested and setting the cookie.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use a narrow or restricted scope for these two attributes. In this way, the <code>Domain</code> attribute should not be set (restricting the cookie just to the origin server) and the <code>Path</code> attribute should be set as restrictive as possible to the web application path that makes use of the session ID.</p>
<p>Setting the <code>Domain</code> attribute to a too permissive value, such as <code>example.com</code> allows an attacker to launch attacks on the session IDs between different hosts and web applications belonging to the same domain, known as cross-subdomain cookies. For example, vulnerabilities in <code>www.example.com</code> might allow an attacker to get access to the session IDs from <code>secure.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is recommended not to mix web applications of different security levels on the same domain. Vulnerabilities in one of the web applications would allow an attacker to set the session ID for a different web application on the same domain by using a permissive <code>Domain</code> attribute (such as <code>example.com</code>) which is a technique that can be used in <a href="http://www.acrossecurity.com/papers/session_fixation.pdf">session fixation attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Although the <code>Path</code> attribute allows the isolation of session IDs between different web applications using different paths on the same host, it is highly recommended not to run different web applications (especially from different security levels or scopes) on the same host. Other methods can be used by these applications to access the session IDs, such as the <code>document.cookie</code> object. Also, any web application can set cookies for any path on that host.</p>
<p>Cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing/hijacking/poisoning attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the DNS resolution to force the web browser to disclose the session ID for a given host or domain.</p>
<h3>Expire and Max-Age Attributes</h3>
<p>Session management mechanisms based on cookies can make use of two types of cookies, non-persistent (or session) cookies, and persistent cookies. If a cookie presents the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Directives"><code>Max-Age</code></a> (that has preference over <code>Expires</code>) or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Directives"><code>Expires</code></a> attributes, it will be considered a persistent cookie and will be stored on disk by the web browser based until the expiration time.</p>
<p>Typically, session management capabilities to track users after authentication make use of non-persistent cookies. This forces the session to disappear from the client if the current web browser instance is closed. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use non-persistent cookies for session management purposes, so that the session ID does not remain on the web client cache for long periods of time, from where an attacker can obtain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that sensitive information is not compromised by ensuring that it is not persistent, encrypting it, and storing it only for the duration of the need</li>
<li>Ensure that unauthorized activities cannot take place via cookie manipulation</li>
<li>Ensure secure flag is set to prevent accidental transmission over the wire in a non-secure manner</li>
<li>Determine if all state transitions in the application code properly check for the cookies and enforce their use</li>
<li>Ensure entire cookie should be encrypted if sensitive data is persisted in the cookie</li>
<li>Define all cookies being used by the application, their name and why they are needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML5 Web Storage API</h2>
<p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) describes the HTML5 Web Storage APIs, <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, as mechanisms for storing name-value pairs client-side.
Unlike HTTP cookies, the contents of <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are not automatically shared within requests or responses by the browser and are used for storing data client-side.</p>
<h3>The localStorage API</h3>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>Data stored using the <code>localStorage</code> API is accessible by pages which are loaded from the same origin, which is defined as the scheme (<code>https://</code>), host (<code>example.com</code>), port (<code>443</code>) and domain/realm (<code>example.com</code>).
This provides similar access to this data as would be achieved by using the <code>secure</code> flag on a cookie, meaning that data stored from <code>https</code> could not be retrieved via <code>http</code>. Due to potential concurrent access from separate windows/threads, data stored using <code>localStorage</code> may be susceptible to shared access issues (such as race-conditions) and should be considered non-locking (<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#the-localstorage-attribute">Web Storage API Spec</a>).</p>
<h4>Duration</h4>
<p>Data stored using the <code>localStorage</code> API is persisted across browsing sessions, extending the timeframe in which it may be accessible to other system users.</p>
<h4>Offline Access</h4>
<p>The standards do not require <code>localStorage</code> data to be encrypted-at-rest, meaning it may be possible to directly access this data from disk.</p>
<h4>Use Case</h4>
<p>WHATWG suggests the use of <code>localStorage</code> for data that needs to be accessed across windows or tabs, across multiple sessions, and where large (multi-megabyte) volumes of data may need to be stored for performance reasons.</p>
<h3>The sessionStorage API</h3>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The <code>sessionStorage</code> API stores data within the window context from which it was called, meaning that Tab 1 cannot access data which was stored from Tab 2.
Also, like the <code>localStorage</code> API, data stored using the <code>sessionStorage</code> API is accessible by pages which are loaded from the same origin, which is defined as the scheme (<code>https://</code>), host (<code>example.com</code>), port (<code>443</code>) and domain/realm (<code>example.com</code>).
This provides similar access to this data as would be achieved by using the <code>secure</code> flag on a cookie, meaning that data stored from <code>https</code> could not be retrieved via <code>http</code>.</p>
<h4>Duration</h4>
<p>The <code>sessionStorage</code> API only stores data for the duration of the current browsing session. Once the tab is closed, that data is no longer retrievable. This does not necessarily prevent access, should a browser tab be reused or left open. Data may also persist in memory until a garbage collection event.</p>
<h4>Offline Access</h4>
<p>The standards do not require <code>sessionStorage</code> data to be encrypted-at-rest, meaning it may be possible to directly access this data from disk.</p>
<h4>Use Case</h4>
<p>WHATWG suggests the use of <code>sessionStorage</code> for data that is relevant for one-instance of a workflow, such as details for a ticket booking, but where multiple workflows could be performed in other tabs concurrently. The window/tab bound nature will keep the data from leaking between workflows in separate tabs.</p>

<h2>Web Workers</h2>
<p>Web Workers run JavaScript code in a global context separate from the one of the current window. A communication channel with the main execution window exists, which is called <code>MessageChannel</code>.</p>
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>Web Workers are an alternative for browser storage of (session) secrets when storage persistence across page refresh is not a requirement. For Web Workers to provide secure browser storage, any code that requires the secret should exist within the Web Worker and the secret should never be transmitted to the main window context.</p>
<p>Storing secrets within the memory of a Web Worker offers the same security guarantees as an HttpOnly cookie: the confidentiality of the secret is protected. Still, an XSS attack can be used to send messages to the Web Worker to perform an operation that requires the secret. The Web Worker will return the result of the operation to the main execution thread.</p>
<p>The advantage of a Web Worker implementation compared to an HttpOnly cookie is that a Web Worker allows for some isolated JavaScript code to access the secret; an HttpOnly cookie is not accessible to any JavaScript. If the frontend JavaScript code requires access to the secret, the Web Worker implementation is the only browser storage option that preserves the secret confidentiality.</p>
<h2>Session ID Life Cycle</h2>
<h3>Session ID Generation and Verification: Permissive and Strict Session Management</h3>
<p>There are two types of session management mechanisms for web applications, permissive and strict, related to session fixation vulnerabilities. The permissive mechanism allows the web application to initially accept any session ID value set by the user as valid, creating a new session for it, while the strict mechanism enforces that the web application will only accept session ID values that have been previously generated by the web application.</p>
<p>The session tokens should be handled by the web server if possible or generated via a cryptographically secure random number generator.</p>
<p>Although the most common mechanism in use today is the strict one (more secure), <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/session-use-strict-mode">PHP defaults to permissive</a>. Developers must ensure that the web application does not use a permissive mechanism under certain circumstances. Web applications should never accept a session ID they have never generated, and in case of receiving one, they should generate and offer the user a new valid session ID. Additionally, this scenario should be detected as a suspicious activity and an alert should be generated.</p>
<h3>Manage Session ID as Any Other User Input</h3>
<p>Session IDs must be considered untrusted, as any other user input processed by the web application, and they must be thoroughly validated and verified. Depending on the session management mechanism used, the session ID will be received in a GET or POST parameter, in the URL or in an HTTP header (e.g. cookies). If web applications do not validate and filter out invalid session ID values before processing them, they can potentially be used to exploit other web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection if the session IDs are stored on a relational database, or persistent XSS if the session IDs are stored and reflected back afterwards by the web application.</p>
<h3>Renew the Session ID After Any Privilege Level Change</h3>
<p>The session ID must be renewed or regenerated by the web application after any privilege level change within the associated user session. The most common scenario where the session ID regeneration is mandatory is during the authentication process, as the privilege level of the user changes from the unauthenticated (or anonymous) state to the authenticated state though in some cases still not yet the authorized state. Common scenarios to consider include; password changes, permission changes, or switching from a regular user role to an administrator role within the web application. For all sensitive pages of the web application, any previous session IDs must be ignored, only the current session ID must be assigned to every new request received for the protected resource, and the old or previous session ID must be destroyed.</p>
<p>The most common web development frameworks provide session functions and methods to renew the session ID, such as <code>request.getSession(true)</code> &amp; <code>HttpSession.invalidate()</code> (J2EE), <code>Session.Abandon()</code> &amp; <code>Response.Cookies.Add(new...)</code> (ASP .NET), or <code>session_start()</code> &amp; <code>session_regenerate_id(true)</code> (PHP).</p>
<p>The session ID regeneration is mandatory to prevent <a href="http://www.acrossecurity.com/papers/session_fixation.pdf">session fixation attacks</a>, where an attacker sets the session ID on the victim user's web browser instead of gathering the victim's session ID, as in most of the other session-based attacks, and independently of using HTTP or HTTPS. This protection mitigates the impact of other web-based vulnerabilities that can also be used to launch session fixation attacks, such as HTTP response splitting or XSS (see <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-Slides.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-WP.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>A complementary recommendation is to use a different session ID or token name (or set of session IDs) pre and post authentication, so that the web application can keep track of anonymous users and authenticated users without the risk of exposing or binding the user session between both states.</p>
<h3>Considerations When Using Multiple Cookies</h3>
<p>If the web application uses cookies as the session ID exchange mechanism, and multiple cookies are set for a given session, the web application must verify all cookies (and enforce relationships between them) before allowing access to the user session.</p>
<p>It is very common for web applications to set a user cookie pre-authentication over HTTP to keep track of unauthenticated (or anonymous) users. Once the user authenticates in the web application, a new post-authentication secure cookie is set over HTTPS, and a binding between both cookies and the user session is established. If the web application does not verify both cookies for authenticated sessions, an attacker can make use of the pre-authentication unprotected cookie to get access to the authenticated user session (see <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-Slides.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://media.blackhat.com/bh-eu-11/Raul_Siles/BlackHat_EU_2011_Siles_SAP_Session-WP.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Web applications should try to avoid the same cookie name for different paths or domain scopes within the same web application, as this increases the complexity of the solution and potentially introduces scoping issues.</p>
<h2>Session Expiration</h2>
<p>In order to minimize the time period an attacker can launch attacks over active sessions and hijack them, it is mandatory to set expiration timeouts for every session, establishing the amount of time a session will remain active. Insufficient session expiration by the web application increases the exposure of other session-based attacks, as for the attacker to be able to reuse a valid session ID and hijack the associated session, it must still be active.</p>
<p>The shorter the session interval is, the lesser the time an attacker has to use the valid session ID. The session expiration timeout values must be set accordingly with the purpose and nature of the web application, and balance security and usability, so that the user can comfortably complete the operations within the web application without his session frequently expiring.</p>
<p>Both the idle and absolute timeout values are highly dependent on how critical the web application and its data are. Common idle timeouts ranges are 2-5 minutes for high-value applications and 15-30 minutes for low risk applications. Absolute timeouts depend on how long a user usually uses the application. If the application is intended to be used by an office worker for a full day, an appropriate absolute timeout range could be between 4 and 8 hours.</p>
<p>When a session expires, the web application must take active actions to invalidate the session on both sides, client and server. The latter is the most relevant and mandatory from a security perspective.</p>
<p>For most session exchange mechanisms, client side actions to invalidate the session ID are based on clearing out the token value. For example, to invalidate a cookie it is recommended to provide an empty (or invalid) value for the session ID, and set the <code>Expires</code> (or <code>Max-Age</code>) attribute to a date from the past (in case a persistent cookie is being used): <code>Set-Cookie: id=; Expires=Friday, 17-May-03 18:45:00 GMT</code></p>
<p>In order to close and invalidate the session on the server side, it is mandatory for the web application to take active actions when the session expires, or the user actively logs out, by using the functions and methods offered by the session management mechanisms, such as <code>HttpSession.invalidate()</code> (J2EE), <code>Session.Abandon()</code> (ASP .NET) or <code>session_destroy()/unset()</code> (PHP).</p>
<h3>Automatic Session Expiration</h3>
<h4>Idle Timeout</h4>
<p>All sessions should implement an idle or inactivity timeout. This timeout defines the amount of time a session will remain active in case there is no activity in the session, closing and invalidating the session upon the defined idle period since the last HTTP request received by the web application for a given session ID.</p>
<p>The idle timeout limits the chances an attacker has to guess and use a valid session ID from another user. However, if the attacker is able to hijack a given session, the idle timeout does not limit the attacker's actions, as they can generate activity on the session periodically to keep the session active for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Session timeout management and expiration must be enforced server-side. If the client is used to enforce the session timeout, for example using the session token or other client parameters to track time references (e.g. number of minutes since login time), an attacker could manipulate these to extend the session duration.</p>
<h4>Absolute Timeout</h4>
<p>All sessions should implement an absolute timeout, regardless of session activity. This timeout defines the maximum amount of time a session can be active, closing and invalidating the session upon the defined absolute period since the given session was initially created by the web application. After invalidating the session, the user is forced to (re)authenticate again in the web application and establish a new session.</p>
<p>The absolute session limits the amount of time an attacker can use a hijacked session and impersonate the victim user.</p>
<h4>Renewal Timeout</h4>
<p>Alternatively, the web application can implement an additional renewal timeout after which the session ID is automatically renewed, in the middle of the user session, and independently of the session activity and, therefore, of the idle timeout.</p>
<p>After a specific amount of time since the session was initially created, the web application can regenerate a new ID for the user session and try to set it, or renew it, on the client. The previous session ID value would still be valid for some time, accommodating a safety interval, before the client is aware of the new ID and starts using it. At that time, when the client switches to the new ID inside the current session, the application invalidates the previous ID.</p>
<p>This scenario minimizes the amount of time a given session ID value, potentially obtained by an attacker, can be reused to hijack the user session, even when the victim user session is still active. The user session remains alive and open on the legitimate client, although its associated session ID value is transparently renewed periodically during the session duration, every time the renewal timeout expires. Therefore, the renewal timeout complements the idle and absolute timeouts, specially when the absolute timeout value extends significantly over time (e.g. it is an application requirement to keep the user sessions open for long periods of time).</p>
<p>Depending on the implementation, potentially there could be a race condition where the attacker with a still valid previous session ID sends a request before the victim user, right after the renewal timeout has just expired, and obtains first the value for the renewed session ID. At least in this scenario, the victim user might be aware of the attack as her session will be suddenly terminated because her associated session ID is not valid anymore.</p>
<h3>Manual Session Expiration</h3>
<p>Web applications should provide mechanisms that allow security aware users to actively close their session once they have finished using the web application.</p>
<h4>Logout Button</h4>
<p>Web applications must provide a visible and easily accessible logout (logoff, exit, or close session) button that is available on the web application header or menu and reachable from every web application resource and page, so that the user can manually close the session at any time. As described in <em>Session_Expiration</em> section, the web application must invalidate the session at least on server side.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Unfortunately, not all web applications facilitate users to close their current session. Thus, client-side enhancements allow conscientious users to protect their sessions by helping to close them diligently.</p>
<h3>Web Content Caching</h3>
<p>Even after the session has been closed, it might be possible to access the private or sensitive data exchanged within the session through the web browser cache. Therefore, web applications must use restrictive cache directives for all the web traffic exchanged through HTTP and HTTPS, such as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control"><code>Cache-Control</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Pragma"><code>Pragma</code></a> HTTP headers, and/or equivalent META tags on all or (at least) sensitive web pages.</p>
<p>Independently of the cache policy defined by the web application, if caching web application contents is allowed, the session IDs must never be cached, so it is highly recommended to use the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache="Set-Cookie, Set-Cookie2"</code> directive, to allow web clients to cache everything except the session ID (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41352418">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Additional Client-Side Defenses for Session Management</h2>
<p>Web applications can complement the previously described session management defenses with additional countermeasures on the client side. Client-side protections, typically in the form of JavaScript checks and verifications, are not bullet proof and can easily be defeated by a skilled attacker, but can introduce another layer of defense that has to be bypassed by intruders.</p>
<h3>Initial Login Timeout</h3>
<p>Web applications can use JavaScript code in the login page to evaluate and measure the amount of time since the page was loaded and a session ID was granted. If a login attempt is tried after a specific amount of time, the client code can notify the user that the maximum amount of time to log in has passed and reload the login page, hence retrieving a new session ID.</p>
<p>This extra protection mechanism tries to force the renewal of the session ID pre-authentication, avoiding scenarios where a previously used (or manually set) session ID is reused by the next victim using the same computer, for example, in session fixation attacks.</p>
<h3>Force Session Logout On Web Browser Window Close Events</h3>
<p>Web applications can use JavaScript code to capture all the web browser tab or window close (or even back) events and take the appropriate actions to close the current session before closing the web browser, emulating that the user has manually closed the session via the logout button.</p>
<h3>Disable Web Browser Cross-Tab Sessions</h3>
<p>Web applications can use JavaScript code once the user has logged in and a session has been established to force the user to re-authenticate if a new web browser tab or window is opened against the same web application. The web application does not want to allow multiple web browser tabs or windows to share the same session. Therefore, the application tries to force the web browser to not share the same session ID simultaneously between them.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This mechanism cannot be implemented if the session ID is exchanged through cookies, as cookies are shared by all web browser tabs/windows.</p>
<h3>Automatic Client Logout</h3>
<p>JavaScript code can be used by the web application in all (or critical) pages to automatically logout client sessions after the idle timeout expires, for example, by redirecting the user to the logout page (the same resource used by the logout button mentioned previously).</p>
<p>The benefit of enhancing the server-side idle timeout functionality with client-side code is that the user can see that the session has finished due to inactivity, or even can be notified in advance that the session is about to expire through a count down timer and warning messages. This user-friendly approach helps to avoid loss of work in web pages that require extensive input data due to server-side silently expired sessions.</p>
<h2>Session Attacks Detection</h2>
<h3>Session ID Guessing and Brute Force Detection</h3>
<p>If an attacker tries to guess or brute force a valid session ID, they need to launch multiple sequential requests against the target web application using different session IDs from a single (or set of) IP address(es). Additionally, if an attacker tries to analyze the predictability of the session ID (e.g. using statistical analysis), they need to launch multiple sequential requests from a single (or set of) IP address(es) against the target web application to gather new valid session IDs.</p>
<p>Web applications must be able to detect both scenarios based on the number of attempts to gather (or use) different session IDs and alert and/or block the offending IP address(es).</p>
<h3>Detecting Session ID Anomalies</h3>
<p>Web applications should focus on detecting anomalies associated to the session ID, such as its manipulation. The OWASP <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-appsensor/">AppSensor Project</a> provides a framework and methodology to implement built-in intrusion detection capabilities within web applications focused on the detection of anomalies and unexpected behaviors, in the form of detection points and response actions. Instead of using external protection layers, sometimes the business logic details and advanced intelligence are only available from inside the web application, where it is possible to establish multiple session related detection points, such as when an existing cookie is modified or deleted, a new cookie is added, the session ID from another user is reused, or when the user location or User-Agent changes in the middle of a session.</p>
<h3>Binding the Session ID to Other User Properties</h3>
<p>With the goal of detecting (and, in some scenarios, protecting against) user misbehaviors and session hijacking, it is highly recommended to bind the session ID to other user or client properties, such as the client IP address, User-Agent, or client-based digital certificate. If the web application detects any change or anomaly between these different properties in the middle of an established session, this is a very good indicator of session manipulation and hijacking attempts, and this simple fact can be used to alert and/or terminate the suspicious session.</p>
<p>Although these properties cannot be used by web applications to trustingly defend against session attacks, they significantly increase the web application detection (and protection) capabilities. However, a skilled attacker can bypass these controls by reusing the same IP address assigned to the victim user by sharing the same network (very common in NAT environments, like Wi-Fi hotspots) or by using the same outbound web proxy (very common in corporate environments), or by manually modifying his User-Agent to look exactly as the victim users does.</p>
<h3>Logging Sessions Life Cycle: Monitoring Creation, Usage, and Destruction of Session IDs</h3>
<p>Web applications should increase their logging capabilities by including information regarding the full life cycle of sessions. In particular, it is recommended to record session related events, such as the creation, renewal, and destruction of session IDs, as well as details about its usage within login and logout operations, privilege level changes within the session, timeout expiration, invalid session activities (when detected), and critical business operations during the session.</p>
<p>The log details might include a timestamp, source IP address, web target resource requested (and involved in a session operation), HTTP headers (including the User-Agent and Referer), GET and POST parameters, error codes and messages, username (or user ID), plus the session ID (cookies, URL, GET, POST…).</p>
<p>Sensitive data like the session ID should not be included in the logs in order to protect the session logs against session ID local or remote disclosure or unauthorized access. However, some kind of session-specific information must be logged in order to correlate log entries to specific sessions. It is recommended to log a salted-hash of the session ID instead of the session ID itself in order to allow for session-specific log correlation without exposing the session ID.</p>
<p>In particular, web applications must thoroughly protect administrative interfaces that allow to manage all the current active sessions. Frequently these are used by support personnel to solve session related issues, or even general issues, by impersonating the user and looking at the web application as the user does.</p>
<p>The session logs become one of the main web application intrusion detection data sources, and can also be used by intrusion protection systems to automatically terminate sessions and/or disable user accounts when (one or many) attacks are detected. If active protections are implemented, these defensive actions must be logged too.</p>
<h3>Simultaneous Session Logons</h3>
<p>It is the web application design decision to determine if multiple simultaneous logons from the same user are allowed from the same or from different client IP addresses. If the web application does not want to allow simultaneous session logons, it must take effective actions after each new authentication event, implicitly terminating the previously available session, or asking the user (through the old, new or both sessions) about the session that must remain active.</p>
<p>It is recommended for web applications to add user capabilities that allow checking the details of active sessions at any time, monitor and alert the user about concurrent logons, provide user features to remotely terminate sessions manually, and track account activity history (logbook) by recording multiple client details such as IP address, User-Agent, login date and time, idle time, etc.</p>
<h2>Session Management WAF Protections</h2>
<p>There are situations where the web application source code is not available or cannot be modified, or when the changes required to implement the multiple security recommendations and best practices detailed above imply a full redesign of the web application architecture, and therefore, cannot be easily implemented in the short term.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, or to complement the web application defenses, and with the goal of keeping the web application as secure as possible, it is recommended to use external protections such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that can mitigate the session management threats already described.</p>
<p>Web Application Firewalls offer detection and protection capabilities against session based attacks. On the one hand, it is trivial for WAFs to enforce the usage of security attributes on cookies, such as the <code>Secure</code> and <code>HttpOnly</code> flags, applying basic rewriting rules on the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header for all the web application responses that set a new cookie.</p>
<p>On the other hand, more advanced capabilities can be implemented to allow the WAF to keep track of sessions, and the corresponding session IDs, and apply all kind of protections against session fixation (by renewing the session ID on the client-side when privilege changes are detected), enforcing sticky sessions (by verifying the relationship between the session ID and other client properties, like the IP address or User-Agent), or managing session expiration (by forcing both the client and the web application to finalize the session).</p>
<p>The open-source ModSecurity WAF, plus the OWASP <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/">Core Rule Set</a>, provide capabilities to detect and apply security cookie attributes, countermeasures against session fixation attacks, and session tracking features to enforce sticky sessions.</p>
<h1>Transport Layer Protection</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This cheat sheet provides guidance on how to implement transport layer protection for an application using Transport Layer Security (TLS). When correctly implemented, TLS can provides a number of security benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality - protection against an attacker from reading the contents of traffic.</li>
<li>Integrity - protection against an attacker modifying traffic.</li>
<li>Replay prevention - protection against an attacker replaying requests against the server.</li>
<li>Authentication - allowing the client to verify that they are connected to the real server (note that the identity of the <em>client</em> is not verified unless client certificates are used).</li>
</ul>
<p>TLS is used by many other protocols to provide encryption and integrity, and can be used in a number of different ways. This cheatsheet is primarily focused on how to use TLS to protect clients connecting to a web application over HTTPS; although much of the guidance is also applicable to other uses of TLS.</p>
<h3>SSL vs TLS</h3>
<p>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) was the original protocol that was used to provide encryption for HTTP traffic, in the form of HTTPS. There were two publicly released versions of SSL - versions 2 and 3. Both of these have serious cryptographic weaknesses and should no longer be used.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://tim.dierks.org/2014/05/security-standards-and-name-changes-in.html">various reasons</a> the next version of the protocol (effectively SSL 3.1) was named Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0. Subsequently TLS versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 have been released.</p>
<p>The terms "SSL", "SSL/TLS" and "TLS" are frequently used interchangeably, and in many cases "SSL" is used when referring to the more modern TLS protocol. This cheatsheet will use the term "TLS" except where referring to the legacy protocols.</p>
<h2>Server Configuration</h2>
<h3>Only Support Strong Protocols</h3>
<p>The SSL protocols have a large number of weaknesses, and should not be used in any circumstances. General purpose web applications should default to TLS 1.3 (support TLS 1.2 if necessary) with all other protocols disabled. Where it is known that a web server must support legacy clients with unsupported an insecure browsers (such as Internet Explorer 10), it may be necessary to enable TLS 1.0 to provide support.</p>
<p>Where legacy protocols are required, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7507">"TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV" extension</a> should be enabled in order to prevent downgrade attacks against clients.</p>
<p>Note that PCI DSS <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Migrating-from-SSL-Early-TLS-Info-Supp-v1_1.pdf">forbids the use of legacy protocols such as TLS 1.0</a>.</p>
<h3>Only Support Strong Ciphers</h3>
<p>There are a large number of different ciphers (or cipher suites) that are supported by TLS, that provide varying levels of security. Where possible, only GCM ciphers should be enabled. However, if it is necessary to support legacy clients, then other ciphers may be required.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following types of ciphers should always be disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null ciphers</li>
<li>Anonymous ciphers</li>
<li>EXPORT ciphers</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="TLS_Cipher_String_Cheat_Sheet.md">TLS Cipher String Cheat Sheet</a> for full details on securely configuring ciphers.</p>
<h3>Use Strong Diffie-Hellman Parameters</h3>
<p>Where ciphers that use the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange are in use (signified by the "DHE" or "EDH" strings in the cipher name) sufficiently secure Diffie-Hellman parameters (at least 2048 bits) should be used</p>
<p>The following command can be used to generate 2048 bit parameters:</p>
<p><code>bash
openssl dhparam 2048 -out dhparam2048.pem</code></p>
<p>The <a href="https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html">Weak DH</a> website provides guidance on how various web servers can be configured to use these generated parameters.</p>
<h3>Disable Compression</h3>
<p>TLS compression should be disabled in order to protect against a vulnerability (nicknamed <a href="https://threatpost.com/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312/77006/">CRIME</a>) which could potentially allow sensitive information such as session cookies to be recovered by an attacker.</p>
<h3>Patch Cryptographic Libraries</h3>
<p>As well as the vulnerabilities in the SSL and TLS protocols, there have also been a large number of historic vulnerability in SSL and TLS libraries, with <a href="http://heartbleed.com">Heartbleed</a> being the most well known. As such, it is important to ensure that these libraries are kept up to date with the latest security patches.</p>
<h3>Test the Server Configuration</h3>
<p>Once the server has been hardened, the configuration should be tested. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/01-Testing_for_Weak_Transport_Layer_Security">OWASP Testing Guide chapter on SSL/TLS Testing</a> contains further information on testing.</p>

<h2>Certificates</h2>
<h3>Use Strong Keys and Protect Them</h3>
<p>The private key used to generate the cipher key must be sufficiently strong for the anticipated lifetime of the private key and corresponding certificate. The current best practice is to select a key size of at least 2048 bits. Additional information on key lifetimes and comparable key strengths can be found <a href="http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/">here</a> and in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf">NIST SP 800-57</a>.</p>
<p>The private key should also be protected from unauthorized access using filesystem permissions and other technical and administrative controls.</p>
<h3>Use Strong Cryptographic Hashing Algorithms</h3>
<p>Certificates should use SHA-256 for the hashing algorithm, rather than the older MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. These have a number of cryptographic weaknesses, and are not trusted by modern browsers.</p>
<h3>Use Correct Domain Names</h3>
<p>The domain name (or subject) of the certificate must match the fully qualified name of the server that presents the certificate. Historically this was stored in the <code>commonName</code> (CN) attribute of the certificate. However, modern versions of Chrome ignore the CN attribute, and require that the FQDN is in the <code>subjectAlternativeName</code> (SAN) attribute. For compatibility reasons, certificates should have the primary FQDN in the CN, and the full list of FQDNs in the SAN.</p>
<p>Additionally, when creating the certificate, the following should be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider whether the "www" subdomain should also be included.</li>
<li>Do not include non-qualified hostnames.</li>
<li>Do not include IP addresses.</li>
<li>Do not include internal domain names on externally facing certificates.<ul>
<li>If a server is accessible using both internal and external FQDNs, configure it with multiple certificates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Carefully Consider the use of Wildcard Certificates</h3>
<p>Wildcard certificates can be convenient, however they violate <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Least_privilege">the principal of least privilege</a>, as a single certificate is valid for all subdomains of a domain (such as *.example.org). Where multiple systems are sharing a wildcard certificate, the likelihood that the private key for the certificate is compromised increases, as the key may be present on multiple systems. Additionally, the value of this key is significantly increased, making it a more attractive target for attackers.</p>
<p>The issues around the use of wildcard certificates are complicated, and there are <a href="https://blog.sean-wright.com/wildcard-certs-not-quite-the-star/">various</a> other <a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/7e5cad8c0726fd6a5e90360a754fc568">discussions</a> of them online.</p>
<p>When risk assessing the use of wildcard certificates, the following areas should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only use wildcard certificates where there is a genuine need, rather than for convenience.<ul>
<li>Consider the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment">ACME</a> to allow systems to automatically request and update their own certificates instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never use a wildcard certificates for systems at different trust levels.<ul>
<li>Two VPN gateways could use a shared wildcard certificate.</li>
<li>Multiple instances of a web application could share a certificate.</li>
<li>A VPN gateway and a public webserver <strong>should not</strong> share a wildcard certificate.</li>
<li>A public webserver and an internal server <strong>should not</strong> share a wildcard certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider the use of a reverse proxy server which performs TLS termination, so that the wildcard private key is only present on one system.</li>
<li>A list of all systems sharing a certificate should be maintained to allow them all to be updated if the certificate expires or is compromised.</li>
<li>Limit the scope of a wildcard certificate by issuing it for a subdomain (such as <code>*.foo.example.org</code>), or a for a separate domain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use an Appropriate Certification Authority for the Application's User Base</h3>
<p>In order to be trusted by users, certificates must be signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). For Internet facing applications, this should be one of the CAs which are well-known and automatically trusted by operating systems and browsers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">LetsEncrypt</a> CA provides free domain validated SSL certificates, which are trusted by all major browsers. As such, consider whether there are any benefits to purchasing a certificate from a CA.</p>
<p>For internal applications, an internal CA can be used. This means that the FQDN of the certificate will not be exposed (either to an external CA, or publicly in certificate transparency lists). However, the certificate will only be trusted by users who have imported and trusted the internal CA certificate that was used to sign them.</p>
<h3>Use CAA Records to Restrict Which CAs can Issue Certificates</h3>
<p>Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS records can be used to define which CAs are permitted to issue certificates for a domain. The records contains a list of CAs, and any CA who is not included in that list should refuse to issue a certificate for the domain. This can help to prevent an attacker from obtaining unauthorized certificates for a domain through a less-reputable CA. Where it is applied to all subdomains, it can also be useful from an administrative perspective by limiting which CAs administrators or developers are able to use, and by preventing them from obtaining unauthorized wildcard certificates.</p>
<h3>Always Provide All Needed Certificates</h3>
<p>In order to validate the authenticity of a certificate, the user's browser must examine the certificate that was used to sign it and compare it to the list of CAs trusted by their system. In many cases the certificate is not directly signed by a root CA, but is instead signed by an intermediate CA, which is in turn signed by the root CA.</p>
<p>If the user does not know or trust this intermediate CA then the certificate validation will fail, even if the user trusts the ultimate root CA, as they cannot establish a chain of trust between the certificate and the root. In order to avoid this, any intermediate certificates should be provided alongside the main certificate.</p>
<h3>Consider the use of Extended Validation Certificates</h3>
<p>Extended validation (EV) certificates claim to provide a higher level of verification of the entity, as they perform checks that the requestor is a legitimate legal entity, rather than just verifying the ownership of the domain name like normal (or "Domain Validated") certificates. This can effectively be viewed as the difference between "This site is really run by Example Company Inc." vs "This domain is really example.org".</p>
<p>Historically these displayed differently in the browser, often showing the company name or a green icon or background in the address bar. However, as of 2019 both <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/m/#!msg/security-dev/h1bTcoTpfeI/jUTk1z7VAAAJ">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups&amp;hl=en#!topic/firefox-dev/6wAg_PpnlY4">Firefox</a> have announced that they will be removing these indicators, as they do not believe that EV certificates provide any additional protection.</p>
<p>There is no security downside to the use of EV certificates. However, as they are significantly more expensive than domain validated certificates, an assessment should be made to determine whether they provide any additional value</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<h3>Use TLS For All Pages</h3>
<p>TLS should be used for all pages, not just those that are considered sensitive such as the login page. If there are any pages that do not enforce the use of TLS, these could give an attacker an opportunity to sniff sensitive information such as session tokens, or to inject malicious JavaScript into the responses to carry out other attacks against the user.</p>
<p>For public facing applications, it may be appropriate to have the web server listening for unencrypted HTTP connections on port 80, and then immediately redirecting them with a permanent redirect (HTTP 301) in order to provide a better experience to users who manually type in the domain name. This should then be supported with the <a href="#use-http-strict-transport-security">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a> header to prevent them accessing the site over HTTP in the future.</p>
<h3>Do Not Mix TLS and Non-TLS Content</h3>
<p>A page that is available over TLS should not include any resources (such as JavaScript or CSS) files which are loaded over unencrypted HTTP. These unencrypted resources could allow an attacker to sniff session cookies or inject malicious code into the page. Modern browsers will also block attempts to load active content over unencrypted HTTP into secure pages.</p>
<h3>Use the "Secure" Cookie Flag</h3>
<p>All cookies should be marked with the "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies">Secure</a>" attribute, which instructs the browser to only send them over encrypted HTTPS connections, in order to prevent them from being sniffed from an unencrypted HTTP connection. This is important even if the website does not listen on HTTP (port 80), as an attacker performing an active man in the middle attack could present a spoofed webserver on port 80 to the user in order to steal their cookie.</p>
<h3>Prevent Caching of Sensitive Data</h3>
<p>Although TLS provides protection of data while it is in transit, it does not provide any protection for data once it has reached the requesting system. As such, this information may be stored in the cache of the user's browser, or by any intercepting proxies which are configured to perform TLS decryption.</p>
<p>Where sensitive data is returned in responses, HTTP headers should be used to instruct the browser and any proxy servers not to cache the information, in order to prevent it being stored or returned to other users. This can be achieved by setting the following HTTP headers in the response:</p>
<p><code>text
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0</code></p>
<h3>Use HTTP Strict Transport Security</h3>
<p>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) instructs the user's browser to always request the site over HTTPS, and also prevents the user from bypassing certificate warnings. See the <a href="HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md">HTTP Strict Transport Security cheatsheet</a> for further information on implementing HSTS.</p>
<h3>Consider the use of Client-Side Certificates</h3>
<p>In a typical configuration, TLS is used with a certificate on the server so that the client is able to verify the identity of the server, and to provide an encrypted connection between them. However, there are two main weaknesses with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server does not have any mechanism to verify the identity of the client</li>
<li>The connection can be intercepted by an attacker who is able to obtain a valid certificate for the domain.<ul>
<li>This is most commonly used by businesses to carry out inspection of TLS traffic by installing a trusted CA certificate on there client systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Client certificates address both of these issues by requiring that the client proves their identity to the server with their own certificate. This not only provides strong authentication of the identity of the client, but also prevents an intermediate party from performing TLS decryption, even if they have trusted CA certificate on the client system.</p>
<p>Client certificates are rarely used on public systems due to a number of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuing and managing client certificates introduces significant administrative overheads.</li>
<li>Non-technical users may struggle to install client certificates.</li>
<li>TLS decryption used by many organisations will cause client certificate authentication to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they should be considered for high-value applications or APIs, especially where there are a small number of technically sophisticated users, or where all users are part of the same organisation.</p>
<h3>Consider Using Public Key Pinning</h3>
<p>Public key pinning can be used to provides assurance that the server's certificate is not only valid and trusted, but also that it matches the certificate expected for the server. This provides protection against an attacker who is able to obtain a valid certificate, either by exploiting a weakness in the validation process, compromising a trusted certificate authority, or having administrative access to the client.</p>
<p>Public key pinning was added to browsers in the HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) standard. However, due to a number of issues, it has subsequently been deprecated and is no longer recommended or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Public-Key-Pins">supported by modern browsers</a>.</p>
<p>However, public key pinning can still provide security benefits for mobile applications, thick clients and server-to-server communication. This is discussed in further detail in the <a href="Pinning_Cheat_Sheet.md">Pinning Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>

<h1>Input Validation</h1>
<h2>Goals of Input Validation</h2>
<p>Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering malfunction of various downstream components. Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the external party.</p>
<p>Data from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation, including not only Internet-facing web clients but also backend feeds over extranets, from <a href="https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/">suppliers, partners, vendors or regulators</a>, each of which may be compromised on their own and start sending malformed data.</p>
<p>Input Validation should not be used as the <em>primary</em> method of preventing <a href="Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">XSS</a>, <a href="SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">SQL Injection</a> and other attacks which are covered in respective <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/">cheat sheets</a> but can significantly contribute to reducing their impact if implemented properly.</p>
<h2>Input validation strategies</h2>
<p>Input validation should be applied on both <strong>syntactical</strong> and <strong>Semantic</strong> level.</p>
<p><strong>Syntactic</strong> validation should enforce correct syntax of structured fields (e.g. SSN, date, currency symbol).</p>
<p><strong>Semantic</strong> validation should enforce correctness of their <em>values</em> in the specific business context (e.g. start date is before end date, price is within expected range).</p>
<p>It is always recommended to prevent attacks as early as possible in the processing of the user's (attacker's) request. Input validation can be used to detect unauthorized input before it is processed by the application.</p>
<h2>Implementing input validation</h2>
<p>Input validation can be implemented using any programming technique that allows effective enforcement of syntactic and semantic correctness, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data type validators available natively in web application frameworks (such as <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/validators/">Django Validators</a>, <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/package-summary.html#doc.Usage.validator">Apache Commons Validators</a> etc).</li>
<li>Validation against <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp">XML Schema (XSD)</a> for input in these formats.</li>
<li>Type conversion (e.g. <code>Integer.parseInt()</code> in Java, <code>int()</code> in Python) with strict exception handling</li>
<li>Minimum and maximum value range check for numerical parameters and dates, minimum and maximum length check for strings.</li>
<li>Array of allowed values for small sets of string parameters (e.g. days of week).</li>
<li>Regular expressions for any other structured data covering the whole input string <code>(^...$)</code> and <strong>not</strong> using "any character" wildcard (such as <code>.</code> or <code>\S</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Allow list vs block list</h3>
<p>It is a common mistake to use block list validation in order to try to detect possibly dangerous characters and patterns like the apostrophe <code>'</code> character, the string <code>1=1</code>, or the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, but this is a massively flawed approach as it is trivial for an attacker to bypass such filters.</p>
<p>Plus, such filters frequently prevent authorized input, like <code>O'Brian</code>, where the <code>'</code> character is fully legitimate. For more information on XSS filter evasion please see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet">this wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>Allow list validation is appropriate for all input fields provided by the user. Allow list validation involves defining exactly what IS authorized, and by definition, everything else is not authorized.</p>
<p>If it's well structured data, like dates, social security numbers, zip codes, email addresses, etc. then the developer should be able to define a very strong validation pattern, usually based on regular expressions, for validating such input.</p>
<p>If the input field comes from a fixed set of options, like a drop down list or radio buttons, then the input needs to match exactly one of the values offered to the user in the first place.</p>
<h3>Validating free-form Unicode text</h3>
<p>Free-form text, especially with Unicode characters, is perceived as difficult to validate due to a relatively large space of characters that need to be allowed.</p>
<p>It's also free-form text input that highlights the importance of proper context-aware output encoding and quite clearly demonstrates that input validation is <strong>not</strong> the primary safeguards against Cross-Site Scripting. If your users want to type apostrophe <code>'</code> or less-than sign <code>&lt;</code> in their comment field, they might have perfectly legitimate reason for that and the application's job is to properly handle it throughout the whole life cycle of the data.</p>
<p>The primary means of input validation for free-form text input should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Ensure canonical encoding is used across all the text and no invalid characters are present.</li>
<li><strong>Character category allow-listing:</strong> Unicode allows listing categories such as "decimal digits" or "letters" which not only covers the Latin alphabet but also various other scripts used globally (e.g. Arabic, Cyrillic, CJK ideographs etc).</li>
<li><strong>Individual character allow-listing:</strong> If you allow letters and ideographs in names and also want to allow apostrophe <code>'</code> for Irish names, but don't want to allow the whole punctuation category.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Regular expressions</h3>
<p>Developing regular expressions can be complicated, and is well beyond the scope of this cheat sheet.</p>
<p>There are lots of resources on the internet about how to write regular expressions, including this <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/">site</a> and the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Validation_Regex_Repository">OWASP Validation Regex Repository</a>.</p>
<p>When designing regular expression, be aware of <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">RegEx Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks</a>. These attacks cause a program using a poorly designed Regular Expression to operate very slowly and utilize CPU resources for a very long time.</p>
<p>In summary, input validation should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be applied to all input data, at minimum.</li>
<li>Define the allowed set of characters to be accepted.</li>
<li>Define a minimum and maximum length for the data (e.g. <code>{1,25}</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>public void doPost( HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
  try {
      String zipCode = request.getParameter( "zip" );
      if ( !zipPattern.matcher( zipCode ).matches()  {
          throw new YourValidationException( "Improper zipcode format." );
      }
      // do what you want here, after its been validated ..
  } catch(YourValidationException e ) {
      response.sendError( response.SC_BAD_REQUEST, e.getMessage() );
  }
}
```</p>
<p>Some Allow list validators have also been predefined in various open source packages that you can leverage. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/">Apache Commons Validator</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Client Side vs Server Side Validation</h2>
<p>Be aware that any JavaScript input validation performed on the client can be bypassed by an attacker that disables JavaScript or uses a Web Proxy. Ensure that any input validation performed on the client is also performed on the server.</p>
<h2>Validating Rich User Content</h2>
<p>It is very difficult to validate rich content submitted by a user. For more information, please see the XSS cheatsheet on <a href="Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">Sanitizing HTML Markup with a Library Designed for the Job</a>.</p>
<h2>Preventing XSS and Content Security Policy</h2>
<p>All user data controlled must be encoded when returned in the HTML page to prevent the execution of malicious data (e.g. XSS). For example <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> would be returned as <code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;</code></p>
<p>The type of encoding is specific to the context of the page where the user controlled data is inserted. For example, HTML entity encoding is appropriate for data placed into the HTML body. However, user data placed into a script would need JavaScript specific output encoding.</p>
<p>Detailed information on XSS prevention here: <a href="Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md">OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet</a></p>
<h2>File Upload Validation</h2>
<p>Many websites allow users to upload files, such as a profile picture or more. This section helps provide that feature securely.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.md">File Upload Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<h3>Upload Verification</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use input validation to ensure the uploaded filename uses an expected extension type.</li>
<li>Ensure the uploaded file is not larger than a defined maximum file size.</li>
<li>If the website supports ZIP file upload, do validation check before unzip the file. The check includes the target path, level of compress, estimated unzip size.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upload Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a new filename to store the file on the OS. Do not use any user controlled text for this filename or for the temporary filename.</li>
<li>When the file is uploaded to web, it's suggested to rename the file on storage. For example, the uploaded filename is <em>test.JPG</em>, rename it to <em>JAI1287uaisdjhf.JPG</em> with a random filename. The purpose of doing it to prevent the risks of direct file access and ambiguous filename to evalide the filter, such as <code>test.jpg;.asp or /../../../../../test.jpg</code>.</li>
<li>Uploaded files should be analyzed for malicious content (anti-malware, static analysis, etc).</li>
<li>The file path should not be able to specify by client side. It's decided by server side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Serving of Uploaded Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure uploaded images are served with the correct content-type (e.g. image/jpeg, application/x-xpinstall)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Beware of "special" files</h3>
<p>The upload feature should be using an allow-list approach to only allow specific file types and extensions. However, it is important to be aware of the following file types that, if allowed, could result in security vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>crossdomain.xml</strong> / <strong>clientaccesspolicy.xml:</strong> allows cross-domain data loading in Flash, Java and Silverlight. If permitted on sites with authentication this can permit cross-domain data theft and CSRF attacks. Note this can get pretty complicated depending on the specific plugin version in question, so its best to just prohibit files named "crossdomain.xml" or "clientaccesspolicy.xml".</li>
<li><strong>.htaccess</strong> and <strong>.htpasswd:</strong> Provides server configuration options on a per-directory basis, and should not be permitted. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess">HTACCESS documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Web executable script files are suggested not to be allowed such as <code>aspx, asp, css, swf, xhtml, rhtml, shtml, jsp, js, pl, php, cgi</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Image Upload Verification</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use image rewriting libraries to verify the image is valid and to strip away extraneous content.</li>
<li>Set the extension of the stored image to be a valid image extension based on the detected content type of the image from image processing (e.g. do not just trust the header from the upload).</li>
<li>Ensure the detected content type of the image is within a list of defined image types (jpg, png, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Email Address Validation</h2>
<h3>Syntactic Validation</h3>
<p>The format of email addresses is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.1.2">RFC 5321</a>, and is far more complicated than most people realise. As an example, the following are all considered to be valid email addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;"@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>user+subaddress@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>user@[IPv6:2001:db8::1]</code></li>
<li><code>" "@example.org</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Properly parsing email addresses for validity with regular expressions is very complicated, although there are a number of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-seantek-mail-regexen-03.html#rfc.section.3">publicly available documents on regex</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest caveat on this is that although the RFC defines a very flexible format for email addresses, most real world implementations (such as mail servers) use a far more restricted address format, meaning that they will reject addresses that are <em>technically</em> valid.  Although they may be technically correct, these addresses are of little use if your application will not be able to actually send emails to them.</p>
<p>As such, the best way to validate email addresses is to perform some basic initial validation, and then pass the address to the mail server and catch the exception if it rejects it. This means that any the application can be confident that its mail server can send emails to any addresses it accepts. The initial validation could be as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The email address contains two parts, separated with an <code>@</code> symbol.</li>
<li>The email address does not contain dangerous characters (such as backticks, single or double quotes, or null bytes).<ul>
<li>Exactly which characters are dangerous will depend on how the address is going to be used (echoed in page, inserted into database, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The domain part contains only letters, numbers, hyphens (<code>-</code>) and periods (<code>.</code>).</li>
<li>The email address is a reasonable length:<ul>
<li>The local part (before the <code>@</code>) should be no more than 63 characters.</li>
<li>The total length should be no more than 254 characters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semantic Validation</h3>
<p>Semantic validation is about determining whether the email address is correct and legitimate. The most common way to do this is to send an email to the user, and require that they click a link in the email, or enter a code that has been sent to them. This provides a basic level of assurance that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The email address is correct.</li>
<li>The application can successfully send emails to it.</li>
<li>The user has access to the mailbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>The links that are sent to users to prove ownership should contain a token that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 32 characters long.</li>
<li>Generated using a <a href="Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.md#secure-random-number-generation">secure source of randomness</a>.</li>
<li>Single use.</li>
<li>Time limited (e.g, expiring after eight hours).</li>
</ul>
<p>After validating the ownership of the email address, the user should then be required to authenticate on the application through the usual mechanism.</p>
<h4>Disposable Email Addresses</h4>
<p>In some cases, users may not want to give their real email address when registering on the application, and will instead provide a disposable email address. These are publicly available addresses that do not require the user to authenticate, and are typically used to reduce the amount of spam received by users' primary email addresses.</p>
<p>Blocking disposable email addresses is almost impossible, as there are a large number of websites offering these services, with new domains being created every day. There are a number of publicly available lists and commercial lists of known disposable domains, but these will always be incomplete.</p>
<p>If these lists are used to block the use of disposable email addresses then the user should be presented with a message explaining why they are blocked (although they are likely to simply search for another disposable provider rather than giving their legitimate address).</p>
<p>If it is essential that disposable email addresses are blocked, then registrations should only be allowed from specifically-allowed email providers. However, if this includes public providers such as Google or Yahoo, users can simply register their own disposable address with them.</p>
<h4>Sub-Addressing</h4>
<p>Sub-addressing allows a user to specify a <em>tag</em> in the local part of the email address (before the <code>@</code> sign), which will be ignored by the mail server. For example, if that <code>example.org</code> domain supports sub-addressing, then the following email addresses are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>user@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>user+site1@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>user+site2@example.org</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Many mail providers (such as Microsoft Exchange) do not support sub-addressing. The most notable provider who does is Gmail, although there are many others that also do.</p>
<p>Some users will use a different <em>tag</em> for each website they register on, so that if they start receiving spam to one of the sub-addresses they can identify which website leaked or sold their email address.</p>
<p>Because it could allow users to register multiple accounts with a single email address, some sites may wish to block sub-addressing by stripping out everything between the <code>+</code> and <code>@</code> signs. This is not generally recommended, as it suggests that the website owner is either unaware of sub-addressing or wishes to prevent users from identifying them when they leak or sell email addresses. Additionally, it can be trivially bypassed by using <a href="#disposable-email-addresses">disposable email addresses</a>, or simply registering multiple email accounts with a trusted provider.</p>
<h1>User Privacy Protection</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This OWASP Cheat Sheet introduces mitigation methods that web developers may utilize in order to protect their users from a vast array of potential threats and aggressions that might try to undermine their privacy and anonymity. This cheat sheet focuses on privacy and anonymity threats that users might face by using online services, especially in contexts such as social networking and communication platforms.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Strong Cryptography</h3>
<p>Any online platform that handles user identities, private information or communications must be secured with the use of strong cryptography. User communications must be encrypted in transit and storage. User secrets such as passwords must also be protected using strong, collision-resistant hashing algorithms with increasing work factors, in order to greatly mitigate the risks of exposed credentials as well as proper integrity control.</p>
<p>To protect data in transit, developers must use and adhere to TLS/SSL best practices such as verified certificates, adequately protected private keys, usage of strong ciphers only, informative and clear warnings to users, as well as sufficient key lengths. Private data must be encrypted in storage using keys with sufficient lengths and under strict access conditions, both technical and procedural. User credentials must be hashed regardless of whether or not they are encrypted in storage.</p>
<p>For detailed guides about strong cryptography and best practices, read the following OWASP references:</p>

</ol>
<h3>Support HTTP Strict Transport Security</h3>
<p>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an HTTP header set by the server indicating to the user agent that only secure (HTTPS) connections are accepted, prompting the user agent to change all insecure HTTP links to HTTPS, and forcing the compliant user agent to fail-safe by refusing any TLS/SSL connection that is not trusted by the user.</p>
<p>HSTS has average support on popular user agents, such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Nevertheless, it remains very useful for users who are in consistent fear of spying and Man in the Middle Attacks.</p>
<p>If it is impractical to force HSTS on all users, web developers should at least give users the choice to enable it if they wish to make use of it.</p>
<p>For more details regarding HSTS, please visit:</p>

</ol>
<h3>Digital Certificate Pinning</h3>
<p>Certificate Pinning is the practice of hardcoding or storing a predefined set of information (usually hashes) for digital certificates/public keys in the user agent (be it web browser, mobile app or browser plugin) such that only the predefined certificates/public keys are used for secure communication, and all others will fail, even if the user trusted (implicitly or explicitly) the other certificates/public keys.</p>
<p>Some advantages for pinning are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the event of a CA compromise, in which a compromised CA trusted by a user can issue certificates for any domain, allowing evil perpetrators to eavesdrop on users.</li>
<li>In environments where users are forced to accept a potentially-malicious root CA, such as corporate environments or national PKI schemes.</li>

<h3>Panic Modes</h3>
<p>A panic mode is a mode that threatened users can refer to when they fall under direct threat to disclose account credentials.</p>
<p>Giving users the ability to create a panic mode can help them survive these threats, especially in tumultuous regions around the world. Unfortunately many users around the world are subject to types of threats that most web developers do not know of or take into account.</p>
<p>Examples of panic modes are modes where distressed users can delete their data upon threat, log into fake inboxes/accounts/systems, or invoke triggers to backup/upload/hide sensitive data.</p>
<p>The appropriate panic mode to implement differs depending on the application type. A disk encryption software such as VeraCrypt might implement a panic mode that starts up a fake system partition if the user entered their distressed password.</p>
<p>Email providers might implement a panic mode that hides predefined sensitive emails or contacts, allowing reading innocent email messages only, usually as defined by the user, while preventing the panic mode from overtaking the actual account.</p>
<p>An important note about panic modes is that they must not be easily discoverable, if at all. An adversary inside a victim's panic mode must not have any way, or as few possibilities as possible, of finding out the truth. This means that once inside a panic mode, most non-sensitive normal operations must be allowed to continue (such as sending or receiving email), and that further panic modes must be possible to create from inside the original panic mode (If the adversary tried to create a panic mode on a victim's panic mode and failed, the adversary would know they were already inside a panic mode, and might attempt to hurt the victim).</p>
<p>Another solution would be to prevent panic modes from being generated from the user account, and instead making it a bit harder to spoof by adversaries. For example it could be only created Out Of Band, and adversaries must have no way to know a panic mode already exists for that particular account.</p>
<p>The implementation of a panic mode must always aim to confuse adversaries and prevent them from reaching the actual accounts/sensitive data of the victim, as well as prevent the discovery of any existing panic modes for a particular account.</p>

<h3>Remote Session Invalidation</h3>
<p>In case user equipment is lost, stolen or confiscated, or under suspicion of cookie theft; it might be very beneficial for users to able to see view their current online sessions and disconnect/invalidate any suspicious lingering sessions, especially ones that belong to stolen or confiscated devices. Remote session invalidation can also helps if a user suspects that their session details were stolen in a Man-in-the-Middle attack.</p>
<p>For details regarding session management, please refer to:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Allow Connections from Anonymity Networks</h3>
<p>Anonymity networks, such as the Tor Project, give users in tumultuous regions around the world a golden chance to escape surveillance, access information or break censorship barriers. More often than not, activists in troubled regions use such networks to report injustice or send uncensored information to the rest of the world, especially mediums such as social networks, media streaming websites and email providers.</p>
<p>Web developers and network administrators must pursue every avenue to enable users to access services from behind such networks, and any policy made against such anonymity networks need to be carefully re-evaluated with respect to impact on people around the world.</p>
<p>If possible, application developers should try to integrate or enable easy coupling of their applications with these anonymity networks, such as supporting SOCKS proxies or integration libraries (e.g. OnionKit for Android).</p>

<h3>Prevent IP Address Leakage</h3>
<p>Preventing leakage of user IP addresses is of great significance when user protection is in scope. Any application that hosts external third-party content, such as avatars, signatures or photo attachments; must take into account the benefits of allowing users to block third-party content from being loaded in the application page.</p>
<p>If it was possible to embed 3rd-party, external domain images, for example, in a user's feed or timeline; an adversary might use it to discover a victim's real IP address by hosting it on his domain and watch for HTTP requests for that image.</p>
<p>Many web applications need user content to operate, and this is completely acceptable as a business process; however web developers are advised to consider giving users the option of blocking external content as a precaution. This applies mainly to social networks and forums, but can also apply to web-based e-mail, where images can be embedded in HTML-formatted emails.</p>
<p>A similar issue exists in HTML-formatted emails that contain third-party images, however most email clients and providers block loading of third-party content by default; giving users better privacy and anonymity protection.</p>
<h3>Honesty &amp; Transparency</h3>
<p>If the web application cannot provide enough legal or political protections to the user, or if the web application cannot prevent misuse or disclosure of sensitive information such as logs, the truth must be told to the users in a clear understandable form, so that users can make an educated choice about whether or not they should use that particular service.</p>
<p>If it doesn't violate the law, inform users if their information is being requested for removal or investigation by external entities.</p>
<p>Honesty goes a long way towards cultivating a culture of trust between a web application and its users, and it allows many users around the world to weigh their options carefully, preventing harm to users in various contrasting regions around the world.</p>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>An architectural decision must be made to determine the appropriate method to protect data at rest. There are such wide varieties of products, methods and mechanisms for cryptographic storage.The general practices and required minimum key length depending on the scenario listed below: </p>
<h2>Good practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cryptographic algorithms are up to date and in-line with industry standards. This includes, but is not limited to outdated block ciphers (e.g. DES), stream ciphers (e.g. RC4), as well as hash functions (e.g. MD5) and broken random number generators like Dual_EC_DRBG (even if they are NIST certified). All of these should be marked as insecure and should not be used and removed from the application and server.</li>
<li>Key lengths are in-line with industry standards and provide protection for sufficient amount of time. A comparison of different key lengths and protection they provide taking into account Moore's law is available online.</li>
<li>Cryptographic means are not mixed with each other: e.g. you do not sign with a public key, or try to reuse a keypair used for a signature to do encryption.</li>
<li>Cryptographic parameters are well defined within reasonable range. This includes, but is not limited to: cryptographic salt, which should be at least the same length as hash function output, reasonable choice of password derivation function and iteration count (e.g. PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt), IVs being random and unique, fit-for-purpose block encryption modes (e.g. ECB should not be used, except specific cases), key management being done properly (e.g. 3DES should have three independent keys) and so on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommended Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality algorithms: AES-GCM-256 or ChaCha20-Poly1305;</li>
<li>Integrity algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Blake2;</li>
<li>Digital signature algorithms: RSA (3072 bits and higher), ECDSA with NIST P-384;</li>
<li>Key establishment algorithms: RSA (3072 bits and higher), DH (3072 bits or higher), ECDH with NIST P-384;</li>
<li>Application must be capable of using end-to-end encryption via SSL / TLS in relation to sensitive data in transit and at rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you should always rely on secure hardware (if available) for storing encryption keys, performing cryptographic operations, etc.</p>
<h2>Secure Cryptographic Storage Design</h2>
<ul>
<li>All protocols and algorithms for authentication and secure communication should be well vetted by the cryptographic community. </li>
<li>Ensure certificates are properly validated against the hostnames users  whom they are meant for. </li>
<li>Avoid using wildcard certificates unless there is a business need for it </li>
<li>Maintain a cryptographic standard to ensure that the developer community knows about the approved ciphersuits for network security protocols, algorithms, permitted use, cryptoperiods and Key Management. </li>
<li>Only store sensitive data that you need </li>
</ul>
<h2>Use strong approved Authenticated Encryption</h2>
<p>CCM or GCM are approved Authenticated Encryption modes based on AES algorithm. </p>
<h2>Use strong approved cryptographic algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not implement an existing cryptographic algorithm on your own, no matter how easy it appears. * Instead, use widely accepted algorithms and widely accepted implementations.  </li>
<li>Only use approved public algorithms such as AES, RSA public key cryptography, and SHA-256 or better for hashing. </li>
<li>Do not use weak algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA1. </li>
<li>Avoid hashing for password storage,instead use Argon2, PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.  </li>
<li>See NIST approved algorithms or ISO TR 14742 "Recommendations on Cryptographic Algorithms or Algorithms", key size and parameters by  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security.  </li>
<li>If a password is being used to protect keys then the password strength should be sufficient for the strength of the keys it is protecting.  * When 3DES is used, ensure K1 != K2 != K3, and the minimum key length must be 192 bits .  </li>
<li>Do not use ECB mode for encrypting lots of data (the other modes are better because they chain the blocks of data together to improve the data security).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use strong random numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all random numbers, especially those used for cryptographic parameters (keys, IV's, MAC tags), random file names, random GUIDs, and random strings are generated in a cryptographically strong fashion. </li>
<li>Ensure that random algorithms are seeded with sufficient entropy. </li>
<li>Tools like NIST RNG Test tool can be used to comprehensively assess the quality of a Random Number Generator by reading e.g. 128MB of data from the RNG source and then assessing its randomness properties with the tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following libraries are considered weak random numbers generators and should not be used: </p>
<ul>
<li>C library: random(), rand(), use getrandom(2) instead;        </li>
<li>Java library: java.util.Random() instead use java.security.SecureRandom instead.      </li>
</ul>
<p>For secure random number generation, refer to NIST SP 800-90A. CTR-DRBG, HASH-DRBG, HMAC-DRBG are recommended.</p>

<h1>Application Regular Updates</h1>
<p>Mobile devices and platforms, such as, for example, smartphones, typically provide the capability for operating system (OS), firmware (FW) and applications updates or re-installations with reduced user involvement. The user involvement may often be limited to clicking an icon or accepting an agreement. While this reduced level of involvement may provide convenience and an improved user experience, it fails to address the issue of secure user authentication.</p>
<p>Mobile devices and platforms, such as smartphones, typically provide features for operating system (OS), firmware (FW) upgrades, and applications or reinstallations with reduced user engagement. User engagement may be limited to clicking an icon or accepting a contract. While this reduced level of engagement can provide convenience and enhance the user experience, it does not address the issue of secure user authentication. Thus, it is necessary to create a secure channel that provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication and data updating.</p>
<h2>Requirements for a secure software update</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Confidentiality: the contents of transmitted data should be kept confidential. This also includes software updates. Thus, secure channels between the mobile device and the network manager must be set up. The standard approach to keep sensitive data secret is to encrypt the data with a key that is shared only between the intended receivers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integrity: it must be possible to ensure that data packets have not been modified in transit. For mobile devices, control requests, and software updates it is critically important to verify that the contents in the packets have not been tampered with;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Authentication: To prevent an attacker from injecting packets it is important to make sure that the receiver can verify the sender of the packets. Data authentication ensures this property such that the receiver can verify that the received packets really are from the claimed sender. For example, for software updates, data authentication is needed such that the device can verify that the received software comes from a trusted source. Data authentication can be achieved using a MAC or Digital Signature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Freshness: to protect against replay attacks, e.g., during the key establishment phase, the protocol must ensure that the messages are fresh. Data freshness ensures the security property that the data is recent and that an attacker is not replaying old data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Third-Party Applications</h1>
<p>Many social networks also offer the possibility to create additional applications that extend the functionality of the network. The two major platforms for such applications are the Facebook Platform and Open Social. While applications designed for the Facebook Platform can only be executed in Facebook, Open Social is a combined effort to allow developers to run their applications on any social network that supports the Open Social platform (e.g., MySpace and Orkut).</p>
<h2>Requirements for a secure third-party applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secure Computation: No external entity should be able to observe or interfere with the computation performed by trustworthy remote entity (TRE). Since the adversary has physical access to the platform, the confidentiality and integrity must be protected from untrusted sofware on the same platform;</li>
<li>Secure Communication: Communication between the TRE and other parties must be confidential and integrity-prtected;</li>
<li>Strong Attestation: The root of trust used for attestation must be trusted by all parties. The attestation mus be unambiguously linked to the communicating entity (authenticity) to avoid masquerading attacks, and must concey the current state of the system (freshness) to prevent replay attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that process or query sensitive information should run in a trusted and secure environment. To create this environment, the app can check the device for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIN - or password-protected device locking;</li>
<li>Recent Mobile Plataform or OS version;</li>
<li>USB Debugging activation;</li>
<li>Device encryption;</li>
<li>Device rooting (see also "Testing Root Detection").</li>
</ul>

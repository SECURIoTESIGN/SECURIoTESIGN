<h1>Brute Force Attacks</h1>
<p>This type of attack consists in trying to access a system using some mechanism or simply 
using trial-and-error, aiming to guess the password of a legitimate user of 
that system. The success of this attack depends largely on the cryptographic scheme used for authentication 
and access control to the system, as well as the nature of the password set by the legitimate user.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this attack, some asset, namely, information, functionality, identity, etc., is protected 
by a finite secret value. The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using 
trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of 
finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset. 
Examples of secrets can include, but are not limited to, passwords, encryption keys, database 
lookup keys, and initial values to one-way functions. The key factor in this attack is the attackers' 
ability to explore the possible secret space rapidly. This, in turn, is a function of the size of the 
secret space and the computational power the attacker is able to bring to bear on the problem. 
If the attacker has modest resources and the secret space is large, the challenge facing the 
attacker is intractable. Assuming a finite secret space, a brute force attack will eventually 
succeed. The defender must rely on making sure that the time and resources necessary to do so will 
exceed the value of the information.</p>
<p>This type of attack can be carried out in two different ways:
1. Encryption Brute Forcing;
2. Password Brute Forcing.</p>

<h1>Eavesdropping Attacks</h1>
<p>Eavesdropping is a type of attack where the attacker tries to gain access to sensitive information 
of legitimate users from the messages (text, voice and video) exchanged between two or more users 
of Instant Messaging (IM) applications. The same applies to recorded calls, call logs and multimedia 
stored in clear text in memory cards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An adversary intercepts a form of communication (e.g. text, audio, video) by way of software (e.g., microphone 
and audio recording application), hardware (e.g., recording equipment), or physical means (e.g., physical proximity). 
The goal of eavesdropping is typically to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about the target for 
financial, personal, political, or other gains. It entails listening in on the raw 
audio source of a conversation between two or more parties. This type of attack can be carried out in two different ways:
1. Shoulder Surfing (Physical Eavesdropping);
2. Probe Audio and Video Peripheralsn (Software Eavesdropping).</p>

<h1>Cross Site Scripting Attacks</h1>
<p>In short, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to execute a browser script bypassing access control mechanisms such as the same origin policy. During this attack a malicious script is injected into web content and user considering it to be authentic executes it over its own machine, thus giving either control of the machine or exposure of confidential information to the attacker.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Being an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications, the attacker in this type of attack executes malicious database claims, exploiting improper validation of data flowing from the user to the database. The attacker's goal is to access the intended party's confidential data by inserting malicious code into the user's web page in order to redirect them to their site. There are two ways to forge this type of attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stored XSS (uninterruptedly stores malicious code in a resource managed by the web application);</li>
<li>Reflective XSS (promptly reflects malicious code against the user and therefore does not store it permanently;</li>
<li>XSS based on DOM (Document Object Model).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cache Poisoning Attacks</h1>
<p>In this type of attack the attacker uses DNS to convert the domain name to an IP address for the purpose of accessing the user's confidential data. On the other hand, sender and a receiver get rerouted through some evil connection.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Cache poisoning is the act of introducing false information into a Domain Name System (DNS) cache in order to cause DNS queries to return an incorrect response and, e.g., redirect users to malicious websites. This type of attack can target the cache of an application (e.g., a web browser cache) or a public cache (e.g. a DNS or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache), exposing the application to a variety of attacks, such as redirection to malicious websites and malware injection.</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" src="attackModels/cachePoisoningAttackTree.png" /></p>
<h1>Malicious QR Code Attacks</h1>
<p>In this type of attack, one of the strategies used by the attackers, after coding the malicious links, is to take them to phishing sites or execute fraudulent codes. In addition, in order to end this type of attack, the attackers often print the malicious QR codes on small stickers that are pasted on pre-existing QR codes. On the other hand, attackers often change selected modules from white to black and vice versa in order to replace the original encoded content.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>QR code-based attack is defined as an attack that attempts to lure victims into scanning a QR code that directs them to malicious websites. The key idea behind QR code attacks is that victims might trust the web page or the printed material on which the QR code is displayed, and assume that the associated code is harmless. In addition, attackers use malicious QR codes to direct users to fraudulent web sites, which masquerade as legitimate web sites aiming to steal sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords or credit card information. </p>
<h2>Technical Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>High Risk.</li>

<h2>CAPTCHA Breaking Attacks Diagram</h2>
<h1>Flooding or Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)  Attacks</h1>
<p>Flooding is an enhanced Denial of Service (DoS) attack type, originating from multiple network attack surfaces that were previously compromised to disrupt the services or resources provided by the target server. It differs from DoS in that it generates more traffic, so that the targeted server cannot handle requests. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The Flooding attack attempts to make a service unavailable to intended users by draining the system or network resource. Attackers can now launch various DDoS attacks, including resource-focused attacks (eg, network bandwidth, memory, and CPU) and app-focused attacks (e.g., mobile applications, database service) from almost every attack places. This type of attack can be executed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP Flood;</li>
<li>UDP Flood;</li>
<li>ICMP Flood;</li>

<h1>Eavesdropping or Sniffing</h1>
<p>This type of attack is carried out by attackers who use applications that can capture data packets in transit over a network, and if they are not heavily encrypted, can be read or interpreted. The goal of the attacker is to spy on all kinds of conversations and recordings and to listen to communication channels.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>This type of attack consists of implant eavesdropping tools in specific network for spying on communication channels, capturing the network traffic behavior and getting the network map. Eavesdropping is dangerous threat that leads to break down the integrity and confidentiality which causes financial and personal failures. There are several ways to get a sniffing attack on a smartphone, as there is a vulnerability in GSM's encryption function for call and SMS privacy, A5 / 1 (it can be stopped second). This vulnerability puts all GSM subscribers at risk of sniffing attacks. </p>

<h1>Phishing Attack</h1>
<p>In phishing attack, an adversary sets up a fake URL identical to real Web application fooling the users to enter a valid credentials and certificates.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information or to make somebody act in a desired way by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication medium. They are usually targeted at large groups of people. Phishing attacks can be performed over almost any channel, from physical presence of the attacker to websites, social networks or even cloud services. On the other hand, phishing attacks are typically fraudulent email messages which directs to spoofed website. In PaaS cloud environment, these attacks affect both enterprise and users. This is a type of social engineering attack. These attackers convince the customers to reveal their most important data like password or other sensitive information by using bogus web pages, emails, or bloggers.</p>

<h1>XML Injection Attacks</h1>
<p>It is an attacking technique used against XML-based applications to modify or compromise their normal operation.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>XML Injection (XMLi) attacks are carried out by injecting pieces of XML code along with malicious content into user inputs in order to produce harmful XML messages. The aim of this type of attacks is to compromise the system or system component that receives user inputs, making it malfunction (e.g. crash), or to attack other systems or subsequent components that process those injected XML messages. This type of attack can be classified into 4 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deforming: Attack input values of Type 1 are XML meta-characters, such as &lt;, &gt;, ]] &gt;, that are intro- duced to compromise the structure of generated XML messages;</li>
<li>Random closing tags: Attack input values of Type 2 are random XML closing tags (e.g., &lt; /test&gt;), aiming at deforming the generated XML messages to reveal their structure;</li>
<li>Replicating: Attack input values of Type 3 are strings of characters consisting of XML tag names and malicious content;</li>
<li>Replacing: Attack input values of Type 4 are similar to those of Type 3 but they involve multiple input fields in order to comment out some existing XML elements and inject new ones with malicious content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attacker Powers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obtain confidential information;</li>
<li>Change the underlying business logic of the destination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>To ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to Spoofing attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security tests present in the full report are followed to ensure authenticity, integrity, privacy and authenticity of the data.

<h1>Spoofing Attacks</h1>
<p>In a nutshell, spoofing attacks consist of spoofing the caller ID in order to impersonate a trusted entity and thus obtain confidential information in a disguised manner.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In this type of attack, the attacker can spoof the "Caller ID" and impersonate him as a legitimate user, i.e., an attacker could spoof the "Caller ID" and impersonate a trusted party. Recent studies have also shown how to spoof MMS messages that appeared to be messages from a number that operators use to send alerts or update notifications. In addition, base stations can also be counterfeited. On the other hand, there is also the mobile application spoofing attack, which consists of an attack where a malicious mobile application mimics the visual appearance of another one. The goal of the adversary is to trick the user into believing that she is interacting with a genuine application while she interacts with one controlled by the adversary. If such an attack is successful, the integrity of what the user sees as well as the confidentiality of what she inputs into the system can be violated by the adversary. </p>

<h1>VM Migration Attacks</h1>
<p>A malicious user can start or redirect the migration process to a different network in which he has access or untrusted host, or it can just be copied and used elsewhere, which compromise the VM with the passwords, credentials on it and in case of coping it makes it difficult to trace the attacker.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>VMs roll back to their previous state if an error occurs. Unfortunately, this factor can re-expose them to security vulnerabilities, and attackers can gain benefit to attack on this compromised hypervisor. It is important to protect the data during migration. In fact, this is the defending of data privacy and integrity from various network attacks during migration. Live migration might be susceptible to many attacks like ”man-in-the-middle”, ”denial-of-service” and ”replay. The data during the migration can be sniffed or tampered easily as it is not encrypted.</p>

<h1>VM Escape Attacks</h1>
<p>This type of attack occurs when an application escapes from the VM and gains control of VMM, as it escapes the VM privilege and obtains the root privilege.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>VM escape is where an application running on a VM can directly have access to the host machine by bypassing the hypervisor, being the root of the system it makes this application escape the VM privilege and gain the root privilege. In this type of attack the attackers attempt to break down the guest OS in order to access the hypervisor or to penetrate the functionalities of other guest OS and underlying host OS. This breaking of the guest OS is called as escape. If the attackers escapes the guest OS it may compromise the hypervisor and as a result it may control over the entire guest OS. In this way the security breach in single point in hypervisor may break down all the hypervisor. If the attacker controls the hypervisor, it can do anything to the VM on the host system.</p>
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>

<h1>Side-Channel Attacks</h1>
<p>It is a type of attack enabled by leakage of information from a physical cryptosystem.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Side-channel attacks use statistical models such as differential analysis and correlation analysis on the information leaked from the cryptographic device during runtime. While early attacks required attackers to be in physical possession of the device, newer side-channel attacks such as cache-timing attacks or DRAM row buffer attacks are conducted remotely by executing malicious software in the targeted cloud environment. Regarding smartphones/tablets, they have developed more sophisticated side-channel attacks that target the built-in sensors of these devices, allowing them to infer keyboard input on touchscreens through sensor readings of native applications and websites, infer a user's location by the power consumption available in the proc file system (procfs), and infer a user's identity, location and diseases through procfs.</p>

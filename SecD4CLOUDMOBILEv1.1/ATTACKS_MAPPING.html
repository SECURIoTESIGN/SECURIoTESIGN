<h1>Malicious QR Code Attacks</h1>
<p>In this type of attack, one of the strategies used by the attackers, after coding the malicious links, is to take them to phishing sites or execute fraudulent codes. In addition, in order to end this type of attack, the attackers often print the malicious QR codes on small stickers that are pasted on pre-existing QR codes. On the other hand, attackers often change selected modules from white to black and vice versa in order to replace the original encoded content.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>QR code-based attack is defined as an attack that attempts to lure victims into scanning a QR code that directs them to malicious websites. The key idea behind QR code attacks is that victims might trust the web page or the printed material on which the QR code is displayed, and assume that the associated code is harmless. In addition, attackers use malicious QR codes to direct users to fraudulent web sites, which masquerade as legitimate web sites aiming to steal sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords or credit card information. </p>

<h1>Flooding or Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)  Attacks</h1>
<p>Flooding is an enhanced Denial of Service (DoS) attack type, originating from multiple network attack surfaces that were previously compromised to disrupt the services or resources provided by the target server. It differs from DoS in that it generates more traffic, so that the targeted server cannot handle requests. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The Flooding attack attempts to make a service unavailable to intended users by draining the system or network resource. Attackers can now launch various DDoS attacks, including resource-focused attacks (eg, network bandwidth, memory, and CPU) and app-focused attacks (e.g., mobile applications, database service) from almost every attack places. This type of attack can be executed as follows:</p>
<ul>

<h1>XML Injection Attacks</h1>
<p>It is an attacking technique used against XML-based applications to modify or compromise their normal operation.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>XML Injection (XMLi) attacks are carried out by injecting pieces of XML code along with malicious content into user inputs in order to produce harmful XML messages. The aim of this type of attacks is to compromise the system or system component that receives user inputs, making it malfunction (e.g. crash), or to attack other systems or subsequent components that process those injected XML messages. This type of attack can be classified into 4 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deforming: Attack input values of Type 1 are XML meta-characters, such as &lt;, &gt;, ]] &gt;, that are intro- duced to compromise the structure of generated XML messages;</li>
<li>Random closing tags: Attack input values of Type 2 are random XML closing tags (e.g., &lt; /test&gt;), aiming at deforming the generated XML messages to reveal their structure;</li>
<li>Replicating: Attack input values of Type 3 are strings of characters consisting of XML tag names and malicious content;</li>
<li>Replacing: Attack input values of Type 4 are similar to those of Type 3 but they involve multiple input fields in order to comment out some existing XML elements and inject new ones with malicious content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attacker Powers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obtain confidential information;</li>
<li>Change the underlying business logic of the destination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>To ensure that the mobile application is resilient or immune to Spoofing attacks, it is recommended that the measures described in the good practice report and the security tests present in the full report are followed to ensure authenticity, integrity, privacy and authenticity of the data.

<h1>Spoofing Attacks</h1>
<p>In a nutshell, spoofing attacks consist of spoofing the caller ID in order to impersonate a trusted entity and thus obtain confidential information in a disguised manner.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In this type of attack, the attacker can spoof the "Caller ID" and impersonate him as a legitimate user, i.e., an attacker could spoof the "Caller ID" and impersonate a trusted party. Recent studies have also shown how to spoof MMS messages that appeared to be messages from a number that operators use to send alerts or update notifications. In addition, base stations can also be counterfeited. On the other hand, there is also the mobile application spoofing attack, which consists of an attack where a malicious mobile application mimics the visual appearance of another one. The goal of the adversary is to trick the user into believing that she is interacting with a genuine application while she interacts with one controlled by the adversary. If such an attack is successful, the integrity of what the user sees as well as the confidentiality of what she inputs into the system can be violated by the adversary. </p>

<h1>VM Migration Attacks</h1>
<p>A malicious user can start or redirect the migration process to a different network in which he has access or untrusted host, or it can just be copied and used elsewhere, which compromise the VM with the passwords, credentials on it and in case of coping it makes it difficult to trace the attacker.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>VMs roll back to their previous state if an error occurs. Unfortunately, this factor can re-expose them to security vulnerabilities, and attackers can gain benefit to attack on this compromised hypervisor. It is important to protect the data during migration. In fact, this is the defending of data privacy and integrity from various network attacks during migration. Live migration might be susceptible to many attacks like ”man-in-the-middle”, ”denial-of-service” and ”replay. The data during the migration can be sniffed or tampered easily as it is not encrypted.</p>

<h1>VM Escape Attacks</h1>
<p>This type of attack occurs when an application escapes from the VM and gains control of VMM, as it escapes the VM privilege and obtains the root privilege.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>VM escape is where an application running on a VM can directly have access to the host machine by bypassing the hypervisor, being the root of the system it makes this application escape the VM privilege and gain the root privilege. In this type of attack the attackers attempt to break down the guest OS in order to access the hypervisor or to penetrate the functionalities of other guest OS and underlying host OS. This breaking of the guest OS is called as escape. If the attackers escapes the guest OS it may compromise the hypervisor and as a result it may control over the entire guest OS. In this way the security breach in single point in hypervisor may break down all the hypervisor. If the attacker controls the hypervisor, it can do anything to the VM on the host system.</p>
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Critical Risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attacker Powers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown and eliminate target or victim VMs, resulting in the loss and destruction of data or information;</li>

<h1>Side-Channel Attacks</h1>
<p>It is a type of attack enabled by leakage of information from a physical cryptosystem.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Side-channel attacks use statistical models such as differential analysis and correlation analysis on the information leaked from the cryptographic device during runtime. While early attacks required attackers to be in physical possession of the device, newer side-channel attacks such as cache-timing attacks or DRAM row buffer attacks are conducted remotely by executing malicious software in the targeted cloud environment. Regarding smartphones/tablets, they have developed more sophisticated side-channel attacks that target the built-in sensors of these devices, allowing them to infer keyboard input on touchscreens through sensor readings of native applications and websites, infer a user's location by the power consumption available in the proc file system (procfs), and infer a user's identity, location and diseases through procfs.</p>

<h1>Reverse Engineering Attacks</h1>
<p>Typically, this attack consists of using specific tools to analyze the target application (feature or resources), within its own local environment, downloaded from a mobile application store, such as Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, respectively.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Reverse engineering attacks (REA) target the assets embedded in software. In such an attack scenario, the attacker by reverse engineering attempts to steal confidential information, such as embedded cryptographic keys or intellectual property in the form of algorithms. There are two ways of carrying out this type of attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>White Box Reverse Engineering;</li>
<li>Black Box Reverse Engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reveal information about back end servers;</li>
<li>Reveal cryptographic constants and ciphers;</li>
<li>Steal intellectual property;</li>
<li>Perform attacks against back end systems;</li>
<li>Gain intelligence needed to perform subsequent code modification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>High Risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Likelihood of Exploit</h2>

<h1>Audit Log Manipulation Attacks</h1>
<p>This type of attack targets log files for the purpose of manipulating (deleting, reading, and altering) them.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In a log file audit manipulation attack scenario, an attacker injects, manipulates, deletes, or forges malicious entries in the log file in an attempt to deceive a log file audit or to cover impressions of an attack. The success of this type of attack depends on the insufficiency of log file access controls mechanisms.</p>

<h1>Wi-Fi Jamming Attacks</h1>
<p>In a scenario of this type of attack, the attacker targets the wireless network made available from the access point, with the aim of making it unavailable.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>This is a denial-of-service attack that blocks the radio frequency, making access to the Wi-Fi network and consequently to the Internet unavailable. Generally, two techniques are used to carry out this type of attack, namely: 1) The attacker may flood the Wi-Fi access point (e.g. the retransmission device) with deauthentication frames; 2) Another method is to transmit high levels of noise on the RF band used by the Wi-Fi network.</p>
<h2>Technical Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resource Consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical Severity</h2>
<ul>
<li>High.</li>

<h1>Wi-Fi SSID Tracking Attacks</h1>
<p>Unlike code injection, in this type of attack, an attacker exploits a weakness in the target in order to force arbitrary code to be retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>This type of attack aims to obtain sensitive data (location, routine, trajectory, etc.) of users of mobile devices using Wi-Fi networks to access the Internet. Furthermore, it consists of using sophisticated sniffing devices to bypass authentication (for closed networks), extract and identify the MAC address of the mobile device and establish a match with its potential owner.</p>
<h2>Technical Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read Data;</li>
<li>Bypass Protection Mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical Severity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Very High Risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Likelihood of Exploit</h2>

<h1>Byzantine Attacks</h1>
<p>In a Byzantine attack scenario, the attacker targets the routing protocols of an ad hoc wireless network, aiming to access and modify sensitive data exchanged between two or more entities on this network.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In a mobile ad hoc wireless network, Byzantine attacks are defined as attacks that target routing protocols, in which two or more routers collude to drop, fabricate, modify, or divert packets in an attempt to disrupt routing services.</p>

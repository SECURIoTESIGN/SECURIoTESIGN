# Denial of Service

## Introduction

This guides is focused on providing an overall, common overview with an informative, straight to the point guidance to propose angles on how to battle denial of service (DoS) attacks on different layers. It is by no means complete, however, it should serve as an indicator to inform the reader and to introduce a workable methodology to tackle this issue.

## Application attacks

Application layer attacks focus on rendering applications unavailable by exhausting resources or by making it unusable in a functional way. These attacks do not have to consume the network bandwidth to be effective. Rather they place an operational strain on the application server in such a way that the server becomes unavailable, unusable or non-functional. All attacks exploiting weaknesses on OSI layer 7 protocol stack are generally categorised as application attacks. They are most challenging to identify/mitigate.

**TODO:** List all attacks per category. Because we cannot map remediations one on one with an attack vector, we will first need to list them before discussing the action points

**Slow HTTP** is a DoS attack type where HTTP requests are send very slow and fragmented, one at a time. Until the HTTP request was fully delivered, the server will keep resources stalled while waiting for the missing incoming data. At one moment, the server will reach the maximum concurrent connection pool, resulting in a DoS. From an attacker's perspective, slow HTTP attacks are cheap to perform because they require minimal resources.

### Software Design Concepts

- **Cheap validation first**: Validation that is cheap in resources should be considered first. More (CPU, memory and bandwidth) expensive validation should be performed afterward. The reason is obvious, we want to reduce impact on these resources as soon as possible.
- **Graceful Degradation** is the ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system or application break. DoS caused by application termination is a widespread problem. Implementing a fault tolerant design enables a system or application to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails. Graceful degradation is a core concept to follow during application design phase, in order to limit impact of DoS.
- **Prevent single point of failure**
- **Avoid highly CPU consuming operations**
- **Keep Queues short**
- **Handle Exceptions**
- **Protect overflow and underflow**
- **Threading**: Avoid operations which must wait for completion of large tasks to proceed. Asynchronous operations
- Identify resource intensive pages and plan ahead.

### Session

- **Limit server side session time based on inactivity and a final timeout**: (resource exhaustion) While sessions timeout is most of the time discussed in relation to session security and preventing session hijacking, it is also an important measure to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Limit session bound information storage:** the less data is linked to a session, the less burden a user session has on webserver's performance.

### Input validation

- **Limit file upload size and extensions** (resource exhaustion) to prevent DoS on file space storage or other web application functions which will use the upload as input (e.g. image resizing, PDF creation, etc.)        - [Checklist](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload).
- **Limit total request size** (resource exhaustion) to make it harder for resource consuming DoS attack to succeed.
- **Prevent input based resource allocation** (resource exhaustion).
- **Prevent input based function and threading interaction** (resource exhaustion). User input could influence how many times a function needs to be executed, or how intensive the CPU consumption becomes. Depending on (unfiltered) user input for resource allocation could allow a DoS scenario through resource exhaustion.
- **Input based puzzles** like captchas or simple math problems are often used to 'protect' a web form. They serve a purpose to protect against functionality abuse. The classic example is a webform that will send out an email after posting the request. A captcha could then prevent the mailbox from getting flooded by a malicious attacker or spambot. Notice that this kind of technology will not help defend against DoS attacks.

### Access control

- **Authentication as a means to expose functionality**
- **User lockout** is a scenario where an attacker can take advantage of the application security mechanisms to cause DoS by abusing the login failure.

## Network attacks

**TODO:** (Develop text) Attacks where network bandwidth gets saturation. Volumetric in nature. Amplification techniques make these attacks effective.

**TODO:** (list attacks) NTP amplification, DNS amplification, UDP flooding, TCP flooding

### Network Design Concepts

- **Preventing single point of failure**
- **Pooling**
- **Caching** is the concept that data is stored so future requests for that data can be served faster. The more data is served via caching, to more resilient the application becomes to bandwidth exhaustion.
- **Static resources hosting on a different domain** will reduce the number of http requests on the web application. Images and JavaScript are typical files that are loaded from a different domain. Â 

### Rate limiting

Rate limiting is the process of controlling traffic rate from and to a server or component. It can be implemented on infrastructure as well as on an application level. Rate limiting can be based on (offending) IPs, on IP block lists, on geolocation, etc.

- **Define a minimum ingress data rate limit**, and drop all connections below that rate. Note that if the rate limit is set too low, this could impact clients. Inspect the logs to establish a baseline of genuine traffic rate. (Protection against slow HTTP attacks)
- **Define an absolute connection timeout**
- **Define a maximum ingress data rate limit**, and drop all connections above that rate.
- **Define a total bandwidth size limit** to prevent bandwidth exhaustion
- **Define a load limit**, which specifies the number of users allowed to access any given resource at any given time.

### ISP-Level remediations

- **Filter invalid sender addresses using edge routers**, in accordance with RFC 2267, to filter out IP-spoofing attacks done with the goal of bypassing block lists.
- **Check your ISP services in terms of DDOS beforehand** (support for multiple internet access points, enough bandwidth (xx-xxx Gbit/s) and special hardware for traffic analysis and defence on application level

### Global-Level remediations: Commercial cloud filter services

- Consider using a filter service in order to resist larger attacks (up to 500GBit/s)
- **Filter services** support different mechanics to filter out malicious or non compliant traffic
- **Comply with relevant data protection/privacy laws** - a lot of providers route traffic through USA/UK

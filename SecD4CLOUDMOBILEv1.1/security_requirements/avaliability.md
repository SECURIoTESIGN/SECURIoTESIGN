# Availability 

Refers to the property which ensures that a mobile device or system is accessible and usable upon demand by authorized entities. In other words the mobile cloud-based application need to be always available to access by authorized people.

**Note:** *This requirement is applied were the information is stored.* 

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:                                                                

### 1. Flooding 
          
In this type of attacks, commonly referred to as denial of service (DoS) or distribuited denial of service (DDoS), the attacker attempts to negatively impact of the service or resource availability from authorized users, by using different types vulnerability exploitation or flooding - SYN flooding attacks, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flooding, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flooding, etc. - on the server.                                                              

### 2. Session Hijacking

This type of attack involves an adversary exploiting weaknesses in the use of an application's authentication sessions. Put another way, this type of attack results from the successful exploitation of improper authentication. Its main purpose is account hijacking. The attacker may be able to steal or manipulate an active session and use it to gain unauthorised access to the application.

### 3. Server Side Request Forgery

We are in the presence of a Server Side Request Forgery Attack (SSRF) as long as the web application is vulnerable and redirects the attacker's requests to the internal network and exposes local services to the remote attacker, which introduces different forms of risks.

### 4. Buffer Overflow
                                                          
Buffer overflows is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory. It can be triggered by non-validated inputs that are designed to execute code.

### 5. Spoofing

Spoofing attacks are a fraudulent act in which an entity fakes its identity to attempt to access resources and critical data. There are four variants of the spoofing attack, namely, content spoofing, identity spoofing, resource location spoofing and action spoofing.

### 6. Malware-as-a-Service 

Malicious code, or simply malware, are scripts or programs that can be injected in the Cloud and Mobile ecosystem. Malware are traditionally mainly classified based on two main factors: propagation strategy (e.g., virus or worm) and malicious activity (trojan horse, spyware, adware, rootkits, botnets, ransomware, backdoors and key-loggers).

### 7. Code Injection

This type of attack targets injecting malicious code into user inputs from the interface (web application forms or hybrid mobile applications) of applications written in HTML5.

### 8. Command Injection Attacks

This is a class of attacks to which web applications are susceptible, resulting from the semantic gap existing between database interpretation and web application interpretation, as well as from the inappropriate handling of user input

### 9. SQL Injection Attack

In  this  attack  the  perpetrator injects  malicious command in the system to gain access to information or even to gain control of the entire system. 

### 10. GPS Jamming Attacks 

This attack aims to interrupt or obstruct the communication between the emitting satellite and the device (smartphone/tablet) receiving the GPS signal. Normally, the attack consists of blocking the signal from the receiver, since the receiving signal is weaker compared to the broadcasting signal, and can be carried out in two different ways, namely, blanket jamming, and deception jamming. 

### 11. Orbital Jamming Attacks 

This type of attack targets low-orbit satellites because, although these low-orbit satellites are attractive due to the low power levels required for communications links from terrestrial terminals, they can also be vulnerable to jamming attacks when used in some applications. In fact, a jammer of reasonable power could easily saturate the RF front-end of a low-orbit satellite, resulting in disabling the link across the entire frequency band.

### 12. DoS (Cellular) Jamming Attack 

Interference attacks target radio communication technology (communication between smart devices and base stations). This attack can be caused by noise, interference, disruption or by sending corrupted data packets, with the purpose of causing DoS in the physical transmission of signals on certain routes.

### 13. Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing Attacks 

These are DDoS-type attacks that target a Bluetooth wireless network in order to shut down activity on it. It usually occurs through an attack coming from a connection of malicious entities in a target network.

### 14. Wi-Fi Jamming Attacks 

This is a denial-of-service attack that blocks the radio frequency, making access to the Wi-Fi network and consequently to the Internet unavailable.

### 15. Access Point hijacking 

 This type of attack is a variant of the session hijacking attack and targets the AP access credentials of legitimate administrators. These credentials can be extracted through a sniffing, brute force or MiTM attack. After this, the attacker is able to carry out other types of attacks, such as DoS and Rogue Access Points.

### 16. Phishing

In this type of attack scenario, an attacker can perform a phishing attack by manipulating a web link to attempt to redirect users to a false one and capture user information and account access, with the final objective of stealing sensitive data. Main attacks vectors are e-mail keyloggers through trojan horses and Man-in-the-Middle Attack of data proxies.

### 17. Malicious QR Code 

Although this type of attack also affects the category or application layer, it also falls under the category of Social Engineering attacks as it mainly relies on human behaviour and its vulnerabilities. For example, the victim may be tricked into reading a malicious QR code advertising a fake promotional campaign for a product from a supermarket car park.

### 18. Malicious Insider 

This type of attack occurs when there a malicious entity (client, employee, hypervisor, Cloud provider/corrector, etc.) takes advantage of its privileges to secretly realize a malicious activity, such as information theft and data or physical infrastructure destruction. This type of attack also occurs from client to server, when the person, employee or team with insider knowledge on how the system is built can implant malicious code to fully destroy the Cloud solution.

### 19. Mobile SIM Swapping

This attack targets the SIM card of a smartphone user, i.e. swapping the victim user's SIM card. SIM swapping can happen remotely. A cybercriminal, with a few important details about your life in hand, can answer security questions correctly, impersonate you, and convince your mobile carrier to reassign your phone number to a new SIM card. At that point, the criminal can get access to your phoneâ€™s data and start changing your account passwords to lock you out of your online banking profile, email, and more.

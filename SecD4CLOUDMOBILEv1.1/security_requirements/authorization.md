# Authorization  

The property that determines whether the user or device has rights/privileges to access a resource, or issue commands.  

**Note:** *These requirements or assumptions apply to the secure coding of PHP, C/C++, Java, C#, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Swift programming languages in building mobile Android application and were the information might be accessed from and between the communications in the cloud and mobile ecosystem.*  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks, such as:                                                      

### 1. SQL Injection Attack

In  this  attack  the  perpetrator injects  malicious command in the system to gain access to information or even to gain control of the entire system. 

### 2. XSS Attack

In  this  attack  the  perpetrator injects  malicious code in the system to gain access to information or even to gain control of the entire system.

### 3. Reused IP Address

This type of attack occurs whenever a IP address is reused on a network. This occurs because in a network the number of IP addresses is usually limited, which causes an address assigned to one user to be assigned to another, so that it leaves the network.                         

### 4. Botnet Attacks
 
A botnet is a collection of compromised devices that can be remotely controlled by an attacker, i.e. the bot master. Its main purpose is to steal business information, remote access, online fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, etc.                                    

### 5. Sniffing Attacks

This type of attack is carried out by attackers using applications that can capture data packets in transit on a network, and if they are not heavily encrypted, can be read or interpreted. 
                            
### 6. Wrapping Attacks 
                                                         
In this attack scenario, the attacker duplicates the SOAP message in the course of the translation and sends it to the server as a legitimate user. Therefore, the attacker may interfere with the malicious code. 

### 7. Google Hacking Attacks

This type of attack involves the use of the Google search engine for the purpose of discovering confidential information that a hacker or wrongdoer can use for their benefit by hacking the account of a used.

### 8. Hypervisor Attacks 

Neste tipo de ataque o atacante tem como alvo comprometer a autenticidade dos dados sensíveis dos utilizadores e a disponibilidade de serviços a partir da cloud ao nível das VMs. 

### 9. OS Command Injection
 
Applications are considered vulnerable to the OS command injection attack if they utilize non validated user input in a system level command what can lead to the invocation of scripts injected by the attacker.

### 10. Buffer Overflow
                                                          
Buffer overflows is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory. It can be triggered by non-validated inputs that are designed to execute code.

### 11. Session Fixation 
                                      
The aim of this attack is account hijacking, with the aim of fraudulently accessing the area restricted to legitimate users of a web app or a hybrid mobile app. The success of this attack depends on prior login, as it requires the session ID of a legitimate user of the target application, impersonating the victim, which grants privileges and results in the violation of confidentiality, access control and authorisation of sensitive user data, and theft of money from mobile banking app or mobile interbank application. 
                                                          
### 12. Brute Force

The attacker attempts to gain access to systems' asset (information, functionality, identity, etc.) protected by a finite secret value by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset.

### 13. Cross Site Request Forgery 

Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces the user to execute unintended actions in an application for which it is already authenticated in a given moment. These attacks target unrequested status changes, and not directly data theft, as the attacker cannot see the answer to the forged request.

### 14. MITM Attacks:

In this type of attack, an attacker attempts to intrude on a mail exchange or continuous message between two users or clients of a cloud-based mobile application (client-server).

### 15. VM Escape

This type of attack occurs whenever an application escapes the VM and obtains control over the VMM, as it escalates its VM privileges to root level. The malicious application accesses the host machine, bypassing the hypervisor.

### 16. Malware-as-a-Service 

Malicious code, or simply malware, are scripts or programs that can be injected in the Cloud and Mobile ecosystem. Malware are traditionally mainly classified based on two main factors: propagation strategy (e.g., virus or worm) and malicious activity (trojan horse, spyware, adware, rootkits, botnets, ransomware, backdoors and key-loggers).

### 17. Reverse Engineering

 Reverse engineering attacks target the assets embedded in software. In such an attack scenario, the attacker by reverse engineering attempts to steal confidential information, such as embedded cryptographic keys or intellectual property in the form of algorithms.

### 18. Phishing

In this type of attack scenario, an attacker can perform a phishing attack by manipulating a web link to attempt to redirect users to a false one and capture user information and account access, with the final objective of stealing sensitive data. Main attacks vectors are e-mail keyloggers through trojan horses and Man-in-the-Middle Attack of data proxies.

### 19. Malicious Insider 

This type of attack occurs when there a malicious entity (client, employee, hypervisor, Cloud provider/corrector, etc.) takes advantage of its privileges to secretly realize a malicious activity, such as information theft and data or physical infrastructure destruction. This type of attack also occurs from client to server, when the person, employee or team with insider knowledge on how the system is built can implant malicious code to fully destroy the Cloud solution.

### 20. Mobile SIM Swapping

This attack targets the SIM card of a smartphone user, i.e. swapping the victim user's SIM card. SIM swapping can happen remotely. A cybercriminal, with a few important details about your life in hand, can answer security questions correctly, impersonate you, and convince your mobile carrier to reassign your phone number to a new SIM card. At that point, the criminal can get access to your phone’s data and start changing your account passwords to lock you out of your online banking profile, email, and more.

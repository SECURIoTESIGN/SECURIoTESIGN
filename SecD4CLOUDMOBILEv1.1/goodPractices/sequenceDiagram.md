## uml: sequence diagram

Here I will embed PlantUML markup to generate a sequence diagram.

I can include as many plantuml segments as I want in my Markdown, and the diagrams can be of any type supported by PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
    skinparam backgroundColor #dddeee
    skinparam handwritten true
    actor Customer
    Customer -> "login()" : username & password
    "login()" -> Customer : session token
    activate "login()"
    Customer -> "placeOrder()" : session token, order info
    "placeOrder()" -> Customer : ok
    Customer -> "logout()"
    "logout()" -> Customer : ok
    deactivate "login()"
@enduml
```

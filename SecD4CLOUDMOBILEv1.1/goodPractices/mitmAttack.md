# Man-in-the-Middle Attack

In this type of attack an active Man listening and changing communications between Mobile Device and Cloud. In other hand, in this attack an intruder enters in the ongoing conversation between sender and the receiver and makes them believe that conversation is taking place between them only.


## Definition

This type of attack occurs whenever an attacker intends to intercept communications in order to interpret or alter the original data in transit between the sender and the receiver establishing a conversation.

## Attacker Powers

The attacker generally and depending on whether the communication situation is encrypted or not, is able to modify the cryptographically unprotected communication or modify the cryptographically protected communication. More specifically, it will have the following powers:

 * Steal encryption key;
 * Discover cryptographic key using cryptanalysis;
 * Exploit vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithm;
 * Exploit vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocol.

## Data Freshness    
Status that ensures that data is the most recent, and that old messages are not mistakenly used as fresh or purposely replayed by perpetrators. In other words this requirement provides the guarantee that the data displayed is the most recent .  

### This requirement is applied to the cloud, since it says that messages sent between components of the cloud and mobile ecosystem can be captured and forwarded, by hypothesis and between the communications.  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:
                                                              
** Tampering: **                                                 
 This type of attacks ocurrs when a attacker preforms physical modifications on the hardware where the software is implemented                                               
** Reused IP Address Attack: ** 
In this attack some nods are made more attractive than others by tampering with the routing information, when arriving to the sinkhole node the  messages may be dropped or altered.

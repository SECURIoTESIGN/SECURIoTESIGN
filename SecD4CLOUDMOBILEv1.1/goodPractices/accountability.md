# Accountability
The property that ensures that every action can be traced back to a single user or device .  

## This requirement is applied over Internet transactions.  

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:

## DNS Attacks                                                                
DNS attacks always occur in the case where the attacker makes use of the translation of the domain name in an Internet Protocol (IP) address, in order to access the confidential data of the user in an unauthorized way. 
## MITM Attacks                                                 
In this type of attack, an attacker attempts to intrude on a mail exchange or continuous message between two users or clients of a cloud-based mobile application (client-server).

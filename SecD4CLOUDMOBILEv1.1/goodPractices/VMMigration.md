# VM Migration Attacks

A malicious user can start or redirect the migration process to a different network in which he has access or untrusted host, or it can just be copied and used elsewhere, which compromise the VM with the passwords, credentials on it and in case of coping it makes it difficult to trace the attacker.


## Definition

VMs roll back to their previous state if an error occurs. Unfortunately, this factor can re-expose them to security vulnerabilities, and attackers can gain benefit to attack on this compromised hypervisor. It is important to protect the data during migration. In fact, this is the defending of data privacy and integrity from various network attacks during migration. Live migration might be susceptible to many attacks like ”man-in-the-middle”, ”denial-of-service” and ”replay. The data during the migration can be sniffed or tampered easily as it is not encrypted.
  
## Attacker Powers

 * Launch attacks such as man-in-the-middle, DoS and replay;
 * Detect or tamper with data during migration as it is not encrypted.

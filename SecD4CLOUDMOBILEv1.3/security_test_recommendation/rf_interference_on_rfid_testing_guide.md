# Testing the RF Interference on RFIDs Attack 

1. Start by identifying the type of RFID system in use and the frequency on which they operate. 
2. Shield the system in a Faraday cage to rule out any external electromagnetic interference. 
3. Connect a spectrum analyzer to the antenna and the ground and measure the ambient noise level in the working environment. 
4. Send an active pulse through the antenna and measure the reflected signal. 
5. Compare the received signal and the original pulse signal to evaluate the effect of interference. 
6. Increase the signal amplitude and measure the reflected signal to observe changes. 
7. Change the frequency of the pulse and repeat the measurement. 
8. Use an anechoic chamber to measure the attenuation of RFID signals. 
9. Change the environment and repeat the test to evaluate the systemâ€™s sensitivity. 
10. Record the results and analyze them to determine the system's performance under different conditions.

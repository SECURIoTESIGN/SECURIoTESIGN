# Testing the Node Jamming Attack 

Testing Node Jamming requires understanding the Jamming concepts and commands, as well as the functionality of the program. Here are some steps you can take to test Node Jamming:

1. Create a simple Node Jamming project and familiarize yourself with the commands, configuration, and functionality.

2. Add files to the project (pigeon-holes) and use the corresponding Jamming commands to test adding and removing files.

3. Test the track system, using the commands to verify that nodes are being tracked and that the appropriate nodes/files are being returned to users.

4. Set up a multi-node jamming network and test that data can be routed properly from one node to another.

5. Test the usage of different commands that Node Jamming offers, such as the save/load project configuration command, the mark/checkout command, and the backup/restore command.

6. Monitor the log files for any unexpected errors and test that general functionality is working as expected.

7. Check security settings and open ports, to ensure that the system is well-protected.

8. Verify that all data is encrypted before it is sent out.

9. Run performance tests to assess the speed and behaviour of Node Jamming under different conditions.

10. Test Node Jamming with multiple users, to ensure that the system will not crash or become unresponsive under heavy load.

# Testing the GPS Jamming Attack 

1. Monitor the GPS devices for any abnormal behavior or erratic messages for an extended period.
2. Use a GPS signal jamming device to test the efficacy of the GPS antenna.
3. Use specialized software to check the GPS receiver for any errors. 
4. Check if electromagnetic interference in the area is causing disruption in the GPS frequency. 
5. Shut down the GPS and connect it with a different satellite receiver, in order to check if the device is still receiving data from other satellites.

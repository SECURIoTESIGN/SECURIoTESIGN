# Testing the Wi-Fi Jamming Attack 

1. Set up a Wi-Fi network (or multiple Wi-Fi networks) consisting of a variety of devices.
2. Create a packet capture device and capture the Wi-Fi network traffic.
3. Place the packet capture device in a central location.
4. Set up a jamming device near the Wi-Fi network(s) and activate it.
5. Monitor the packet capture device for any changes in the Wi-Fi network traffic.
6. Analyze the results and evaluate if the jamming device is successfully disrupting the Wi-Fi network(s).
7. Determine the effectiveness of the jamming device and take countermeasures to reduce or eliminate the jamming effect.

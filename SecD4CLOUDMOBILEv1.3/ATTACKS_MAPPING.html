<h1>Man-in-th-Middle Attack</h1>
<p>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is an attack where a threat actor interferes with the communication between two systems. The threat actor inserts itself between the two systems and has access to all the data being sent between them.</p>
<p>MITM attacks are used to steal or modify data in transit, such as banking credentials, passwords, and security tokens. Hackers carry out these attacks by spoofing IP addresses and using malicious code to gain access to unencrypted data. They can also use packet-sniffing software to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
<p>MITM attacks can be done through network-level attacks or application-level attacks. Network-level MITM attacks involve the hacker taking control of the entire communications path between the two hosts. Application level MITM attacks involve the hacker hacking into one of the hosts and manipulating their traffic.</p>
<p>To protect against MITM attacks, it is important to use secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS. It is also important to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted while in transit. Additionally, strong authentication methods should be used to authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Man-in-th-Middle Architectural Risk Analysis:</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to intercept and modify data sent between two parties. This attack is especially dangerous as it can be used to intercept sensitive and confidential information. </p>
<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1 measures the risk of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack along four different vectors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attack vector (AV)</strong> : Remote</li>
<li><strong>Attack complexity (AC)</strong>: Low</li>
<li><strong>Privileges required (PR)</strong>: None</li>
<li><strong>User Interaction (UI)</strong>: None</li>
</ol>
<h3>Risk Score</h3>
<p>Based on the risk factors defined above, the risk score for a Man-in-the-Middle attack using CVSS v3.1 is 7.2. This falls under the medium risk category. </p>
<p><strong>Overall Risk Score: 7.2 (Medium)</strong></p>
<h2>MiTM Attack Tree</h2>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/MiTM_Attack_Tree.JPG" /></p>
<h1>Brute Force Attack</h1>
<p>A Brute Force attack is a type of attack that attempts to guess a user's authentication credentials, such as a username and password, by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is discovered. It is commonly used to gain unauthorised access to secure systems.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Brute Force attacks are often used in combination with other tactics, such as dictionary and rainbow table attacks, to increase the chances of success.</p>
<p>In order to protect against this type of attack, it is recommended to use strong authentication credentials that are difficult to guess, such as long, randomised passwords made up of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. It is also a good idea to set a maximum amount of failed log-in attempts before locking out the user account, as this prevents attackers from attempting to guess the credentials indefinitely.</p>

<h1>Eavesdropping Attack</h1>
<p>Eavesdropping attack is a type of network attack in which the attacker listens to the conversations taking place among two or more authorized users or devices on the same network. This attack allows attackers to collect valuable information, including private data and confidential messages, without being detected. </p>
<p>In this attack, the attacker uses various tools to gain access to the target computer's network, such as sniffers, which are essentially network-based packet sniffers that extract data from the network, and Trojan horses, malicious programs that are secretly installed on the system. The attacker can also use other methods to access the network, such as phishing emails, rogue Wi-Fi access points, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Once the attacker gains access to the network, they eavesdrop on the conversations taking place on the network. By monitoring the data packets being sent over the network, the attacker can gain access to sensitive information and data that they can then use for malicious purposes.</p>
<h2>Eavesdropping Architectural Risk Analysis:</h2>
<p><strong>Eavesdropping Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 score for Eavesdropping Vulnerability is 4.8, categorized under 'High' severity.</p>

<p>CVSS v3.1 Vector String: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L</p>
<p><strong>Risk Analysis of Eavesdropping Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>Eavesdropping Vulnerability poses a high risk to the confidentiality of the data traveling within a network as it allows attackers to intercept and potentially access sensitive information. Without any user interaction, an attacker can intercept information and potentially gain unrestricted access to the confidential data, thus leaving the users’ online operations prone to manipulation. Moreover, the integrity and availability of the network can be impacted to a low extent.</p>
<p>Therefore, organizations need to put in place an effective counter-measures strategy which focuses on enhancing data security measures, including the adoption of strong authentication protocols and encryption technologies, to mitigate and reduce the risk of eavesdropping attacks.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="attack_models/Eavesdropping_Attack_Tree.JPG" /></p>
<h1>Flooding Attack</h1>
<p>Flooding attacks are attempts to inundate a resource with an overwhelming amount of data or requests in order to overwhelm or crash it. Flooding attacks are often effective when the target resource is limited in bandwidth or processing power, such as a server, and is unable to handle so much data or requests, resulting in performance degradation or service disruption.</p>
<p>Examples of flooding attacks include Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which send an extremely large amount of requests/traffic to the victim’s server or network in order to saturate it and make it incapable of responding to legitimate requests. Additionally, there is also the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, which uses more than one computer or device to send the traffic, making it even more of a challenge to defend against.</p>
<p>Flooding attacks can be difficult to detect and stop as they often involve huge volumes of data. However, some steps to help mitigate the effects of flooding attacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing firewalls and other security measures to detect and block suspicious traffic.</li>
<li>Deploying load balancers to distribute the amount of requests over multiple servers or resources.</li>
<li>Monitoring network and server performance to detect anomalies.</li>
<li>Limiting connection requests from a single source.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sniffing Attack</h1>
<p>Sniffing attack is a type of cyber attack in which attackers gain unauthorized access to a network by using methods to capture, monitor, and control data packets in a network. In this attack, malicious users capture data that is being transmitted over the network, such as usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. This is done by sniffing or intercepting packets of data as they pass through the network and capturing them for further analysis. The attackers can then use the data gathered to gain access to networks or to commit data theft.</p>

<h1>Buffer Overflow Attack</h1>
<p>A buffer overflow attack is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program writes data beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. Let’s break down the details:</p>
<h2>How It Happens</h2>
<p><em>Buffer</em>: A buffer is a temporary storage area in a program’s memory. It holds data such as strings, arrays, or other variables.</p>
<p><em>Overflow</em>: When a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold, the excess data spills over into adjacent memory locations.</p>
<p><em>Exploitation</em>: An attacker deliberately crafts input (usually user input) to overflow the buffer and overwrite critical memory areas.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Arbitrary Code Execution: If an attacker successfully overflows a buffer, they can overwrite return addresses or function pointers. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control over the program.
Denial of Service (DoS): Buffer overflows can crash programs, causing service disruptions.
Information Leakage: Sensitive data (such as passwords or encryption keys) stored in adjacent memory locations may be exposed.</p>

<h1>Spoofing Attack</h1>
<p>Spoofing is a method of attack in which a malicious actor successfully masquerades as a legitimate user or node in a computer network. Spoofing attacks occur when an attacker makes it appear as though their network traffic is coming from a trusted source while they carry out malicious activities. By spoofing the source of the traffic, attackers can launch attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, phishing attacks, network sniffing attacks, and more. It is important to recognize and be aware of spoofing attacks so as to protect yourself from potential threats.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Malicious insider vulnerabilities occur when a malicious employee, contractor, or third-party accesses an organization's systems or data and is able to make unauthorized changes or steal confidential information. In this attack scenario, the malicious actor has a high degree of privileges, which allows them to access the systems or data on a large scale. The scope of the attack is changed due to the malicious actor's ability to manipulate the data or systems, and this has a high impact on the organization in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. </p>
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 assesses malicious insider vulnerabilities with a Base Score of 9.8, indicating a Critical severity level. This is further broken down into an Exploitability Subscore of 8.6, and an Impact Subscore of 10.0. Given the privileged access of the malicious actor, the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, and user interaction all factor into the exploitability subscore of 8.6. The scope of the attack and the associated impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system warrant the high Impact Subscore of 10.0.</p>

<h1>VM Escape Attack</h1>
<p>VM (Virtual Machine) Escape attacks involve compromised VMs that act as an entry point for an intruder to gain access to the larger system. It occurs when attackers use vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escape the confines of a virtual machine and gain access to the underlying physical server or network. Through this attack, attackers can gain control of the physical server and execute malicious activities such as stealing data, disrupting service, and deleting critical files.</p>
<p>These attacks are especially dangerous since they bypass security measures, including firewalls, that are typically in place to protect physical servers and networks. Therefore, it is important for organizations to be vigilant and implement measures to protect against VM escape attacks. One way of doing this is by keeping VMs updated and running the latest security patches. Additionally, limiting the access and privileges of VMs can also help to reduce the attack surface.</p>

<h1>Side-Channel Attack</h1>
<p>Side-channel attacks are a class of security exploits that target physical implementation of systems, such as the way data is stored, transmitted, and processed, rather than exploiting logical flaws in the system itself. These attacks use unintentional information leakage from a system’s physical implementation—such as processor or memory timing, power consumption, radio frequency (RF) emission, or the sound similar systems make—to gain insights into the system’s internals and the data it is processing. Such leaked information can be used by an adversary to reverse engineer the system’s implementation, compromising its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>

<h1>Cryptanalysis Attack</h1>
<p>Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing encrypted data in order to find weaknesses that can be exploited to gain access to the plaintext. It is an incredibly powerful technique that has been used to crack many of the world's most powerful encryption algorithms. Cryptanalysis can be used to attack both symmetric and asymmetric encryption systems. </p>
<p>The goal of cryptanalysis is to gain access to the plaintext without knowing the secret key. It can be done in a variety of ways, such as frequency analysis, differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, brute-force attack, etc. Attackers typically use a combination of these techniques to find a weakness in the security system. </p>
<p>By using cryptanalysis, attackers can gain access to sensitive data without the need to decode the entire encrypted document or message. This makes cryptanalysis an important tool for attackers because it allows them to easily bypass complex encryption schemes.</p>

<h1>Byzantine Attack</h1>
<h3>Byzantine Attack</h3>
<p>A Byzantine attack is a type of cyber attack wherein the malicious attacker attempts to corrupt or disrupt normal operations within a network by broadcasting false messages throughout the system. The aim of the attack is to cause confusion and possible system failure by introducing messages that appear to be coming from genuine sources, but in reality are not. Such attacks are often employed in distributed computer networks, such as those used by banks, military organizations, and other critical systems.</p>

<p>Byzantine attacks are among the most dangerous security risks and are caused by malicious nodes that cause a distributed system to malfunction. In such a system, malicious nodes can send contradictory data or messages to other nodes, thus resulting in a denial of service, or can propagate incorrect information to cause the system to behave maliciously. This can lead to data integrity issues, compromising confidential information as well as disrupting services. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 assigns a Base Score of 7.2 to a Byzantine attack vulnerability. This score is determined by the parameters listed in the table above.</p>
<p>Attack Vector: The attack vector for such a vulnerability is set to Network (N) as the malicious nodes aim to disrupt the system via networking, or by sending incorrect messages or data over the network.</p>
<p>Attack Complexity: Low (L) is assigned to this vulnerability because it does not require expertise to execute, as the malicious nodes simply need to send incorrect messages.</p>
<p>Privileges Required: Since the malicious nodes do not require any special privileges to propagate incorrect data, the value is set to None (N).</p>
<p>User Interaction: As the attack does not require users to interact or perform any specific actions, the value is set to None (N).</p>
<p>Scope: While the malicious nodes can affect multiple nodes in a system, the scope is unfortunately Unchanged (U), as the malicious nodes do not gain any additional privileges due to the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Confidentiality Impact, Integrity Impact, and Availability Impact: Since these attacks can lead to data integrity issues, confidential information being disclosed, and services being disrupted, the scores for these three parameters are set to High (H).</p>
<p>Severity</p>

<h1>Spectre Attack</h1>
<p>Spectre is a type of side-channel attack that exploits the speculative execution process used by modern computer processors. The attackers are able to extract sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys from the memory of other processes running on the same computer, even if those processes are in the same trusted environment (e.g., a virtual machine (VM)).</p>
<p>Spectre attack exploits a vulnerability in the way modern CPUs execute programs speculatively. Specifically, when the processor encounters a branch instruction during a process, it goes ahead and predicts which branch will be taken and runs the instructions in that branch, even though the branch may not end up being taken after all. This behavior was designed to speed up the execution of programs. However, it can be abused to leak sensitive data in other processes on the same system.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by a technique called "side-channel attack" which works by measuring how long certain instructions take to execute to gain insights into what data the processor is using. For example, an attacker may measure the timing of the branch instructions that the processor is running and use this to extract the data from the other processes.</p>
<p>The danger with Spectre is that this attack technique can be used to extract sensitive data from processes running in a trusted environment, including trusted VMs. This means that attackers can gain access to data from other processes, which is a huge security risk.</p>
<h2>Spectre Arquitectural Risk Analysis</h2>
<p>According to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1, Spectre Attack Vulnerability has the following ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base score:</strong> 6.1</li>
<li><strong>Attack vector:</strong> Local</li>
<li><strong>Attack complexity:</strong> High</li>

<li><strong>User interaction:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> Unchanged</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality Impact:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Integrity Impact:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Availability Impact:</strong> Low</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With a base score of 6.1, the Spectre Attack Vulnerability carries a medium-severity risk from a local attack. The attack's high complexity mitigates the attack; however, this attack still carries a high confidentiality and integrity impact despite its lower availability impact.</p>

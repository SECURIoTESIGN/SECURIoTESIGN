<h1>IoT Security Best Practices Guidelines</h1>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices fall into three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors, which gather data;</li>
<li>Actuators, which effect actions;</li>
<li>Gateways, which act as communication hubs and may also implement some 
automation logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these device types may stand alone or be embedded in a larger product. They may also be complemented by a web application or mobile device app and cloud based service.
IoT devices, services and software, and the communication  channels that connect them, are at risk of attack by a variety of malicious parties.</p>
<p>Malicious intent commonly takes advantage of poor design, but even unintentional leakage of data due to ineffective security controls can also bring dire consequences to consumers and vendors. Thus it is vital that IoT devices and services have security designed in from the outset.</p>
<h2>Classification of Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define a data classification scheme and document it; </li>
<li>Assess every item of data stored, processed, transmitted or received by a device and apply a data classification rating to it;</li>
<li>Ensure the security design protects every data item and collections of items against unauthorised viewing, changing or deletion, to at least its classification rating or higher.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Physical Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any interface used for administration or test purposes during development should be removed from a production device, disabled or made physically inaccessible;</li>
<li>All test access points on production units must be disabled or locked, for example by blowing on-chip fuses to disable JTAG;</li>
<li>If a production device must have an administration port, ensure it has effective access controls, e.g. strong credential management, restricted ports, secure protocols etc.;</li>
<li>Make the device circuitry physically inaccessible to tampering, e.g. epoxy chips to circuit board, resin encapsulation, hiding data and address lines under these components etc;</li>
<li>Provide secure protective casing and mounting options for deployment of devices in exposed locations;</li>
<li>For high-security deployments, consider design measures such as active masking or shielding to protect against side-channel attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Device Secure Boot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the ROM-based secure boot function is always used. Use a multi-stage boot loader initiated by a minimal amount of read-only code; </li>
<li>Use a hardware-based tamper-resistant capability (e.g. a microcontroller security subsystem, Secure Access Module (SAM) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM)) to store crucial data items and run the trusted authentication/cryptographic functions required for the boot process. Its limited secure storage capacity must hold the read-only first stage of the boot loader and all other data required to verify the authenticity of firmware;</li>
<li>Check each stage of boot code is valid and trusted immediately before running that code. Validating code immediately before its use can reduce the risk of attacks; </li>
<li>At each stage of the boot sequence, wherever possible, check that only the expected hardware is present and matches the stage's configuration parameters;</li>
<li>Do not boot the next stage of device functionality until the previous stage has been successfully booted;</li>
<li>Ensure failures at any stage of the boot sequence fail gracefully into a secure state, to ensure no unauthorised access is gained to underlying systems, code or data. Any code run must have been previously authenticated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secure Operating System</h2>
<ul>
<li>Include in the operating system (OS) only those components (libraries, modules, packages etc.) that are required to support the functions of the device;</li>
<li>Shipment should include the latest stable OS component versions available;</li>
<li>Devices should be designed and shipped with the most secure configuration in place; </li>
<li>Continue to update OS components to the latest stable versions throughout the lifetime of a deployed device;</li>
<li>Disable all ports, protocols and services that are not used;</li>
<li>Set permissions so users/applications cannot write to the root file system;</li>
<li>If required, accounts for ordinary users/applications must have minimum access rights to perform the necessary functions. Separate administrator accounts (if required)will have greater rights of access. Do not run anything as root unless genuinely unavoidable;</li>
<li>Ensure all files and directories are given the minimum access rights to perform the required functions;</li>
<li>Consider implementing an encrypted file system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications must be operated at the lowest privilege level possible, not as root. Applications must only have access to those resources they need; </li>
<li>Applications should be isolated from each other. For example, use sandboxing techniques such as virtual machines, containerisation, Secure Computing Mode (seccomp), etc</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with in-country data processing regulations;</li>
<li>Ensure all errors are handled gracefully and any messages produced do not reveal any sensitive information;</li>
<li>Never hard-code credentials into an application. Credentials must be stored separately in secure trusted storage and must be updateable in a way that ensures security is maintained;</li>
<li>Remove all default user accounts and passwords;</li>
<li>Use the most recent stable version of the operating system and libraries;</li>
<li>Never deploy debug versions of code. The distribution should not include compilers, files containing developer comments, sample code, etc.;</li>
<li>Consider the impact on the application/system if network connectivity is lost. Aim to maintain  normal functionality and security wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credential Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>A device should be uniquely identifiable by means of a factory-set tamper resistant hardware identifier if possible;</li>
<li>Use good password management techniques, for example no blank or simple passwords allowed,  never send passwords across a network (wired or wireless) in clear text, and employ a secure password reset process;</li>
<li>Each password stored for authenticating credentials must use an industry standard hash function, along with a unique salt value that is not obvious (for example, not a username);</li>
<li>Store credentials or encryption keys in a Secure Access Module (SAM), Trusted Platform Module  (TPM), Hardware Security Module (HSM) or trusted key store if possible;</li>
<li>Aim to use 2-factor authentication for accessing sensitive data if possible;</li>
<li>Ensure a trusted &amp; reliable time source is available where authentication methods require this, e.g. for digital certificates;</li>
<li>A certificate used to identify a device must be unique and only used to identify that onedevice. Do not reuse the certificate across multiple devices;</li>
<li>A "factory reset" function must fully remove all user data/credentials stored on a device.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<ul>
<li>When configuring a secure connection, if an encryption protocol offers a negotiable selection of algorithms, remove weaker options so they cannot be selected for use in a downgrade attack;</li>
<li>Store encryption keys in a Secure Access Module (SAM), Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Hardware Security Module (HSM) or trusted key store if possible;</li>
<li>Do not use insecure protocols, e.g. FTP, Telnet;</li>
<li>It should be possible to securely replace encryption keys remotely;</li>
<li>If implementing public/private key cryptography, use unique keys per device and avoid using global keys. A device's private key should be generated by that device or supplied by an associated secure credential solution, e.g. smart card. It should remain on that  device and never be shared/visible to elsewhere. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Network Connections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Activate only those network interfaces that are required (wired, wireless - including Bluetooth etc.);</li>
<li>Run only those services on the network that are required;</li>
<li>Open up only those network ports that are required;</li>
<li>Run a correctly configured software firewall on the device if possible;</li>
<li>Always use secure protocols, e.g. HTTPS, SFTP;</li>
<li>Never exchange credentials in clear text or over weak solutions such as HTTP Basic Authentication;</li>
<li>Authenticate every incoming connection to ensure it comes from a legitimate source.</li>
<li>Authenticate the destination before sending sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure all logged data comply with prevailing data protection regulations;</li>
<li>Run the logging function in its own operating system process, separate from other functions;</li>
<li>Store log files in their own partition, separate from other system files.</li>
<li>Set log file maximum size and rotate logs;</li>
<li>Where logging capacity is limited, just log start-up and shutdown parameters, login/access attempts and anything unexpected;</li>
<li>Restrict access rights to log files to the minimum required to function;</li>
<li>If logging to a central repository, send log data over a secure channel if the logs carry sensitive data and/or protection against tampering of logs must be assured;</li>
<li>Implement log "levels" so that lightweight logging can be the standard approach, but with the option to run more detailed logging when required;</li>
<li>Monitor and analyse logs regularly to extract valuable information and insight;</li>
<li>Passwords and other secret information should not ever be displayed in logs.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Authentication</h1>
<h1>Security Best Practices for Authentication</h1>
<p>Authentication is an important part of the security of any system. Here are best practices that should be followed to ensure a secure authentication process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and should include both upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.</li>
<li>Use multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This requires users to provide additional forms of authentication, such as a one-time code sent to a phone or email.</li>
<li>Use a security question to protect accounts. This should be a question that is difficult for outsiders to answer but easy for the user to remember.</li>
<li>Require users to change their password regularly. This helps reduce the risk of stolen credentials.</li>
<li>Don’t allow the same password to be used again after expiration or change.</li>
<li>Limit log-in attempts. If too many invalid attempts are made, lock the account. </li>
<li>Implement a lockout policy. After a certain number of failed attempts, lock the account and require the user to reset the password.</li>
<li>Monitor user log-ins and suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Don’t store passwords in plain text. All passwords should be encrypted.</li>
<li>Use security protocols such as TLS or SSL.</li>
<li>Keep authentication systems up-to-date with the latest patches and security fixes. </li>
<li>Ensure that all staff are properly trained on authentication best practices.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Authorization</h1>
<h2>Authorization: Security Best Practices Guidelines</h2>
<p>Authorization refers to the process of determining what users or groups of users are able to access certain resources in a system. Ensuring the appropriate security of authorization processes is an important part of maintaining the privacy and security of systems and data. </p>
<p>The following are some best practices to help ensure the proper security of authorization processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement multiple authentication factors to provide both authorization and identification.</li>
<li>Regularly monitor and audit user access to data and systems and ensure that access is only granted to the necessary individuals.</li>
<li>Follow the principle of least privilege when providing user access to systems and data - only provide users with the least level of access necessary to perform their tasks. </li>
<li>Follow data segregation and separation of duties to reduce the potential risk of compromised authentication.</li>
<li>Ensure authorization processes are enforced across all organizational devices and systems.</li>
<li>Utilize an authorization system that allows for periodic audits and reviews, as well as the ability to track changes.</li>
<li>Establish protocols and policies that clearly define grant and access management practices.</li>
<li>Utilize a password management system in order to provide users with secure and easy access to authorization credentials.</li>
<li>Ensure authorization processes are kept up-to-date with the latest security protocols.</li>
<li>Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and investigate suspicious activities.</li>
<li>Provide users and administrators with consistent and continuous authorization training.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Transaction Authorization</h1>
<h2>Purpose and audience</h2>
<p>The Purpose of this cheat sheet is to provide guidelines on how to securely implement transaction authorization to protect it from being bypassed. These guidelines can be used by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks</strong> - to define functional and non-functional requirements for transaction authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> – to design and implement transaction authorization without vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Pentesters</strong> – to test for transaction authorization security.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Some applications use a second factor to check whether an authorized user is performing sensitive operations. A common example is wire transfer authorization, typically used in online or mobile banking applications.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this document we will call that process: <em>transaction authorization</em>.</p>
<p>Usage scenarios are not only limited to financial systems. For example: an email with a secret code or a link with some kind of token to unlock a user account is also a special case of transaction authorization. A user authorizes the operation of account unlocking by using a second factor (a unique code sent to his email address). Transaction authorization can be implemented using various methods, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards with transaction authorization numbers (TAN),</li>
<li>Time based OTP tokens, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">OATH TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)</a>,</li>
<li>OTP sent by SMS or provided by phone</li>
<li>Digital signature using e.g. a smart card or a smart phone,</li>
<li>Challenge-response tokens, including unconnected card readers or solutions which scan transaction data from the user's computer screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these can be implemented on a physical device or in a mobile application.</p>
<p>Transaction authorization is implemented in order to protect for unauthorized wire transfers as a result of attacks using malware, phishing, password or session hijacking, CSRF, XSS, etc.. Unfortunately, as with any piece of code, this protection can be improperly implemented and as a result it might be possible to bypass this safeguard.</p>
<h2>1. Functional Guidelines</h2>
<h3>1.1 Transaction authorization method has to allow a user to identify and acknowledge significant transaction data</h3>
<p>User's computers cannot be trusted due to malware threats. Hence a method that prevents a user from identifying transaction on an external device cannot be considered as secure. Transaction data should be presented and acknowledged using an external authorization component.</p>
<p>Such transaction authorization components should be built using the <em>What You See Is What You Sign</em> principle. When a user authorizes a transaction they need to know what they are authorizing. Based on this principle, an authorization method must permit a user to identify and acknowledge the data that is significant to a given transaction. For example, in the case of a wire transfer: the target account and amount.</p>
<p>The decision about which transaction data can be considered as significant should be chosen based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real risk,</li>
<li>The technical capabilities and constraints of the chosen authorization method,</li>
<li>Positive user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example when an SMS message is used to send significant transaction data, it is possible to send the target account, amount and type of transfer. However, for an unconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Authentication_Program">CAP reader</a> it is perceived to be inconvenient for a user to enter these data. In such cases, entering only the most significant transaction data (e.g. partial target account number and amount) can be considered sufficient.</p>
<p>In general, significant transaction data should always be presented as an inherent part of the transaction authorization process. Whereas the user experience should be designed to encourage users to verify the transaction data.</p>
<p>If a transaction process requires a user to enter transaction data into an external device, the user should be prompted for providing specific value (e.g. a target account number). Entering a value without meaningful prompt could be easily abused by malware using social engineering techniques as described in the example in paragraph 1.4. Also, for more detailed discussion of input overloading problems, see <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/fc09optimised.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h3>1.2 Change of authorization token should be authorized using the current authorization token</h3>
<p>When a user is allowed to change authorization token by using the application interface, the operation should be authorized by using his current authorization credentials (as is the case with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Password_Change_or_Reset_Functionalities.html">password change procedure</a>). For example: when a user changes a phone number for SMS codes an authorization SMS code should be sent to the current phone number.</p>
<h3>1.3 Change of authorization method should be authorized using the current authorization method</h3>
<p>Some applications allow a user to chose between multiple methods of transaction authorization. In such cases, the user should authorize the change in authorization method using his current authorization method. Otherwise, malware may change the authorization method to the most vulnerable method.</p>
<p>Additionally, the application should inform the user about the potential dangers associated to the selected authorization method.</p>
<h3>1.4 Users should be able to easily distinguish the authentication process from the transaction authorization process</h3>
<p>Malware can trick users in authorizing fraudulent operations, when an application requires a user to perform the same actions for authentication as for transaction authorization. Consider the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application is using the same method for user authentication (usually as a second factor to traditional login/password) and for transaction authorization. E.g. by using a OTP token, Challenge-response codes, operation signing using external smartcard, ...</li>
<li>A malware may present the user a false error message after the first step (authentication to the application) and trick the user into repeating the authentication procedure. The first authentication code will be used by the malware for authentication, whereas the second code would be used to authorize a fraudulent transaction. Even challenge-response schemes could be abused using this scenario as malware can present a challenge taken from a fraudulent transaction and trick the user to provide response. Such an attack scenario is used widely in <a href="http://securityintelligence.com/back-basics-malware-authors-downgrade-tactics-stay-radar/#.VX_qI_krLDc">malware attacks against electronic banking</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the abovementioned scenario, the same method was used to authenticate the user and to authorize the transaction. Malware can abuse this behavior to extract transaction authorization credentials without the user's knowledge. Social engineering methods <a href="http://securityintelligence.com/tatanga-attack-exposes-chiptan-weaknesses/#.VZAy9PkrLDc">can be used despite utilized authentication and operation authorization methods</a> but the application shouldn't simplify such attack scenarios.</p>
<p>Safeguards should allow the user to easily distinguish authentication from transaction authorization. This could be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using different methods to authenticate and to authorize,</li>
<li>Or using different actions in an external security component (e.g. different mode of operation in CAP reader),</li>
<li>Or presenting the user a clear message about what they are "signing" (What You See Is What You Sign Principle).</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5 Each transaction should be authorized using unique authorization credentials</h3>
<p>Some applications are asking for transaction authorization credentials only once, e.g. static password, code sent through SMS, token response. Afterwards a user is able to authorize any transaction during the whole user's session or at least they have to reuse the same credentials each time they need to authorize a transaction. Such behavior is not sufficient to prevent malware attacks because malware will sniff such credentials and use them to authorize any transaction without the user's knowledge.</p>
<h2>2. Non-functional guidelines</h2>
<h3>2.1 Authorization should be performed and enforced server-side</h3>
<p>As for <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html">all other security controls</a> transaction authorization should be enforced server-side. By no means it should be possible to influence the authorization result by altering data which flows from a client to a server, e.g. by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tampering with parameters that contain transaction data,</li>
<li>Adding/removing parameters which will disable authorization check,</li>
<li>Causing an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, security programming best practices should be applied, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Positive_security_model">Default deny</a>.</li>
<li>Avoiding debugging functionality in production code.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid tampering, additional safeguards should be considered. For example by cryptographically protecting the data for confidentiality and integrity and while decrypting and verifying the data server side.</p>
<h3>2.2 Authorization method should be enforced server side</h3>
<p>When multiple transaction authorization methods are available to the user. The server should enforce the use of the current authorization method chosen by the user in the application settings or enforced by application policies. It should be impossible to change an authorization method by manipulating the parameters provided from the client. Otherwise, malware can downgrade an authorization method to a less or even the least secure authorization method.</p>
<p>This is especially important when an application is developed to add a new, more secure authorization method. It is not very rare,that a new authorization method is built on top of an old codebase. As a result, when a client is sending parameters using the old method, the transaction may be authorized, despite the fact that the user has already switched to a new method.</p>
<h3>2.3 Transaction verification data should be generated server-side</h3>
<p>When significant transaction data are transmitted programmatically to an authorization component, extra care should be put into denying client modifications on the transaction data at authorization. Significant transaction data that has to be verified by the user, should be generated and stored on a server, then passed to an authorization component without any possibility of tampering by the client.</p>
<p>A common anti pattern is to collect significant transaction data client-side and pass it to the server. In such cases, malware can manipulate these data and as a result, show faked transaction data in an authorization component.</p>
<h3>2.4 Application should prevent authorization credentials brute-forcing</h3>
<p>When transaction authorization credentials are sent to the server for verification, an application has to prevent brute-forcing. The transaction authorization process must be restarted after number of failed authorization attempts. In addition other anti brute-forcing and anti-automation techniques should be considered to prevent an attacker from automating his attacks,see <a href="Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#prevent-brute-force-attacks">OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
<h3>2.5 Application should control which transaction state transitions are allowed</h3>
<p>Transaction authorization is usually performed in multiple steps, e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user enters the transaction data.</li>
<li>The user requests authorization.</li>
<li>The application initializes an authorization mechanism.</li>
<li>The user verifies/confirms the transaction data.</li>
<li>The user responds with the authorization credentials.</li>
<li>The application validates authorization and executes a transaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>An application should process such business logic flow in sequential step order and preventing a user from performing these steps out of order or in even skipping any of these steps (see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/">OWASP ASVS</a> requirement <strong>15.1</strong>).</p>
<p>This should protect against attack techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overwriting transaction data before user will enter the authorization credentials,</li>
<li>Skipping transaction authorization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6 Transaction data should be protected against modification</h3>
<p>The transaction authorization process should protect against attack scenarios that modify transaction data after the initial entry by the user. For example, a bad implementation of a transaction authorization process may allow the following attacks (for reference, see steps of transaction authorization described in paragraph 2.5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaying step 1 (sending transaction data) in the background and overwriting transaction details with fraudulent transaction, before the user enters authorization credentials.</li>
<li>Adding parameters with transaction data to a HTTP request which authorizes the transaction. In such a case, poor implementation will authorize the initial transaction and then execute a fraudulent transaction (specific example of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html">Time of Check to Time of Use vulnerability</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The protection against modification could be implemented using various techniques depending on the framework used, but one or more of the following should be present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any modification of transaction data should trigger invalidation of any previously entered authorization data. E.g. Generated OTP or challenge is invalidated.</li>
<li>Any modification of transaction data should trigger reset of the authorization process.</li>
<li>Any attempts to modify transaction data after the initial entry by the user is a symptom of tinkering with an application and should be logged, monitored and carefully investigated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7 Confidentiality of the transaction data should be protected during any client / server communications</h3>
<p>The transaction authorization process should protect the privacy of transaction data being presented to the user to authorize i.e. at section 2.5, steps 2 and 4.</p>
<h3>2.8 When a transaction is executed, the system should check whether it was authorized</h3>
<p>The result of the transaction entry and the authorization process described in paragraph 2.5 is the transaction execution. Just before the transaction is executed there should be a final control gate which verifies whether the transaction was properly authorized by the user. Such control, tied to execution, should prevent attacks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTOU) – example in paragraph 2.6</li>
<li>Skipping authorization check in the transaction entry process (see. paragraph 2.5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.9 Authorization credentials should be valid only by limited period of time</h3>
<p>In some malware attacks scenarios, authorization credentials entered by the user is passed to malware command and control server (C&amp;C) and then used from an attacker-controlled machine. Such a process is often performed manually by an attacker. To make such attacks difficult, the server should allow authorizing the transaction only in a limited time window between generating of challenge or OTP and the transaction authorization. Additionally, such safeguard will also aid in preventing resource exhaustion attacks. The time window should be carefully selected to not disrupt normal users' behavior.</p>
<h3>2.10 Authorization credentials should be unique for every operation</h3>
<p>To prevent all sorts of replay attacks, authorization credentials should be unique for every operation. It could be achieved using different methods depending on the applied transaction authorization mechanism. For example: using a timestamp, a sequence number or a random value in signed transaction data or as a part of a challenge.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>We identify other issues that should be taken into consideration while implementing transaction authorization. However we deem to be beyond the scope of this cheat sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which transactions should be authorized? All transactions or only some of them. Each application is different and an application owner should decide if all transactions should be authorized or only some of them, considering risk analysis, risk exposition of given application, and other safeguards implemented in an application.</li>
<li>We recommend the use of cryptographic operations to protect transactions and to ensure integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation.</li>
<li>Device enrolment or "pairing" of an external authorization device (or a mobile application) with the user account.</li>
<li>Provisioning &amp; protection of the device signing keys, during device "pairing" is as critical as the signing protocol itself. Malware may attempt to inject/replace or steal the signing keys.</li>
<li>User awareness. E.g.: For transaction authorization methods, when a user types-in significant transaction data to an authorization component (e.g. an external dedicated device or a mobile application), users should be trained to rewrite transaction data from trusted source and not from a computer screen.</li>
<li>There are some anti-malware solutions that protect against malware threats but such solutions <a href="http://www.securing.pl/en/script-based-malware-detection-in-online-banking-security-overview/index.html">do not guarantee 100% effectiveness</a> and should be used only as an additional layer of protection.</li>
<li>Protection of the signing keys using a second factor either be password, biometric, etc..</li>
<li>Protection of the signing keys leveraging secure elements (TEE, TPM, Smart card..)</li>

<h1>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Application</h1>
<h2>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Cloud-Based Mobile Applications</h2>
<p>The following best practices are designed to ensure secure use of Cloud-Based Mobile Applications.</p>
<h3>Proper User Authentication</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authentication should be based on strong credentials such as two-factor authentication whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application passwords should be strong and updated regularly. Make sure to store them securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User accounts should be locked out after multiple failed attempts to discourage brute force attacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Communications</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All communications should be encrypted and authenticated using industry-standard encryption protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile Applications should only communicate with backend services over a secure data channel or VPN</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Data Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All sensitive data should be stored in an encrypted format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data should be stored on secure servers that are regularly patched with the latest security updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to sensitive data should be limited only to authenticated users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Data Transmission</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data transmitted between mobile devices and backend services should be encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All mobile applications should verify the identity of backend services before sending data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Review</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All code should be reviewed by a qualified security professional prior to deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated to ensure that security vulnerabilities are patched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Level Threat Protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mobile applications should be tested for security vulnerabilities and common attack vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile applications should include rate limiting, then monitor and block suspicious requests and activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regular Updating</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All mobile applications should be regularly patched to ensure that they contain the latest security updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, organizations can ensure the secure use of third-party cloud-based mobile applications.</p>

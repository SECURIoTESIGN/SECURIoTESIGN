<h1>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Application</h1>
<h2>Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Cloud-Based Mobile Applications</h2>
<p>The following best practices are designed to ensure secure use of Cloud-Based Mobile Applications.</p>
<h3>Proper User Authentication</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authentication should be based on strong credentials such as two-factor authentication whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application passwords should be strong and updated regularly. Make sure to store them securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User accounts should be locked out after multiple failed attempts to discourage brute force attacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Communications</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All communications should be encrypted and authenticated using industry-standard encryption protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile Applications should only communicate with backend services over a secure data channel or VPN</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Data Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All sensitive data should be stored in an encrypted format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data should be stored on secure servers that are regularly patched with the latest security updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to sensitive data should be limited only to authenticated users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Data Transmission</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data transmitted between mobile devices and backend services should be encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All mobile applications should verify the identity of backend services before sending data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Review</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All code should be reviewed by a qualified security professional prior to deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated to ensure that security vulnerabilities are patched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Level Threat Protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mobile applications should be tested for security vulnerabilities and common attack vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile applications should include rate limiting, then monitor and block suspicious requests and activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regular Updating</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All mobile applications should be regularly patched to ensure that they contain the latest security updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, organizations can ensure the secure use of third-party cloud-based mobile applications.</p>

# Filtering Mechanism Mechanisms 

Security Filtering Mechanisms are built into Cloud-based mobile apps to ensure data is protected from unauthorized access. These mechanisms include multi-factor authentication, data encryption, data loss prevention, and various identity and access management (IAM) tools that control user access and authentication policies. Additionally, mobile app hardening techniques such as static code analysis and dynamic application security testing (DAST) can be used to detect and fix potential security vulnerabilities.

## Filtering Mechanism Mechanisms Examples: 

| Security Requirement | Mobile Platform | Mechanism | Description | OSI Layer |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Authentication      | iOS            | OAuth2   | OAuth2 provides a secure mechanism for authorizing application access to a user's account | Application |
| Encryption          | Android        | AES      | AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) uses symmetric key cryptography to provide strong encryption of data at rest | Data Link |
| Key Management      | Cross-Platform | AWS KMS  | AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is a cloud-based service used to manage encryption keys for encrypting/decrypting data | Transport |
| Data Obfuscation    | Cross-Platform | ProGuard | ProGuard is a popular open source code obfuscator which helps protect your app's code during coding phase and runtime | Physical   |

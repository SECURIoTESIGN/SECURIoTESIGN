# Tamper Detection 

## Tamper Detection 
Tamper detection is a requirement in security engineering that detects and alerts for any changes made to the system. This type of security helps to ensure that confidential information is safe and not accessible to unauthorized personnel. Tamper detection technology can detect any changes made to the system such as adding or removing files, changing configurations, and more. Additionally, tamper detection can trigger other protective measures such as locking down a system or triggering alerts when a malicious attack is detected.

## Warning: 

If we fail to guarantee tamper detection, the security of the system can be compromised. Attackers can try to break into the system, modify data, or even inject malicious code. This can cause a variety of problems such as system crashes, data corruption, and malicious activity. Without the assurance of tamper detection, the system may be vulnerable to malicious activity, and the risk of suffering from a security breach increases.

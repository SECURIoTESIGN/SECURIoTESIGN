# Data Origin Authentication 

## Data Origin Authentication
Data origin authentication is a security engineering requirement that aims to verify that data is sent securely and accurately, and that it is originating from an authenticated and trusted source. It aims to ensure that data sent from one location to another has not been modified in any way.

Data origin authentication typically involves techniques such as message authentication codes (MACs), digital signatures, and public-key infrastructure (PKI) protocols. It can also involve two-factor authentication and the use of cryptography. These techniques can be used to ensure that data is sent securely and with integrity, meaning that the data has not been tampered with or modified in transit.

## Warning: 

**The consequences of failing to guarantee data origin authentication** 

- Untrusted data: Data integrity and authenticity could be compromised as untrusted sources may be allowed into the system, leading to data leakage, manipulation or other malicious activities.
- Reduced trust: Without authentication, it will be difficult to establish trust in any data or systems.
- Security breaches: It is much more likely that malicious actors could infiltrate the system and gain access to confidential information without authentication.
- Loss of data: Without authentication, there would be no way to confirm the accuracy or veracity of the data, leaving the system vulnerable to data loss.
- Increased risk: Without authentication, organizations may be more susceptible to cyber-attacks as malicious actors could easily access confidential data.

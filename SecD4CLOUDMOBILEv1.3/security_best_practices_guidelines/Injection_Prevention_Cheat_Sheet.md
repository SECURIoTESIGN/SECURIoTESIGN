# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Injection Prevention 

# Injection Prevention Best Practices

Injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is unexpectedly executed as code. Injection attacks can come in many forms, including SQLi, OS, and LDAP injections, and can cause substantial data loss and server damage. It is important to take precautions to prevent injection attacks from occurring. 

## General Best Practices 
- Validate user input using whitelisting, type conversion, or other techniques
- Enforce input length and format constraints 
- Implement output encoding for dynamic data
- Reduce attack surface area, minimizing the amount of code accessible to malicious users 
- Sanitize and filter user input
- Check input strings for any malicious code
- Escaping special characters
- Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, and stored procedures for database interaction
- Audit and log all input and output operations
- Use API Gateway to control access to APIs 

## Web Security Best Practices
- Disable the use of backslash and commas in web applications 
- Filter out SQL injection attempts from user input 
- Filter out "naughty strings" (e.g. "DROP TABLE")
- Limit the number of characters in forms
- Sanitize regular expression data
- Use HTTPs for all network traffic
- Permit the use of only known file types
- Disallow the execution of arbitrary command line parameters 
- Validate URL requests 
- Use CAPTCHA for authentication 

Following these best practices can help prevent injection attacks and ensure the safety of your system.

# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Application 

## Security Best Practices Guidelines for Secure Third-party Cloud-Based Mobile Applications

The following best practices are designed to ensure secure use of Cloud-Based Mobile Applications.

### Proper User Authentication 

* Authentication should be based on strong credentials such as two-factor authentication whenever possible.

* Application passwords should be strong and updated regularly. Make sure to store them securely.

* User accounts should be locked out after multiple failed attempts to discourage brute force attacks.

### Secure Communications 

* All communications should be encrypted and authenticated using industry-standard encryption protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS.

* Mobile Applications should only communicate with backend services over a secure data channel or VPN

### Secure Data Storage 

* All sensitive data should be stored in an encrypted format.

* Data should be stored on secure servers that are regularly patched with the latest security updates.

* Access to sensitive data should be limited only to authenticated users.

### Secure Data Transmission 

* All data transmitted between mobile devices and backend services should be encrypted.

* All mobile applications should verify the identity of backend services before sending data.

### Code Review 

* All code should be reviewed by a qualified security professional prior to deployment.

* All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated to ensure that security vulnerabilities are patched.

### Application Level Threat Protection 

* Mobile applications should be tested for security vulnerabilities and common attack vectors.

* Mobile applications should include rate limiting, then monitor and block suspicious requests and activities.

### Regular Updating 

* All mobile applications should be regularly patched to ensure that they contain the latest security updates.

* All external libraries and frameworks should be regularly updated as well.

By following these best practices, organizations can ensure the secure use of third-party cloud-based mobile applications.

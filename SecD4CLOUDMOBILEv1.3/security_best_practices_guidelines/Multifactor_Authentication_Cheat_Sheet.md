# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Multifactor Authentication 

## Security Best Practices Guidelines for Multifactor Authentication


1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where appropriate:
    - Use MFA to protect critical systems, high-value assets, and sensitive data.
    - Utilize a variety of authentication methods, such as biometrics, tokens, etc.

2. Use a password manager:
    - Utilize strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts.
    - Leverage an identity and access management system to securely store and manage user credentials.

3. Monitor user login attempts:
    - Monitor user login attempts (e.g. IP addresses, time of day access, etc.).
    - Set regular reviews and alerts to detect suspicious account activity.

4. Stay up-to-date on attack techniques:
    - Utilize threat intelligence services to gain awareness about attack trends.
    - Continuously monitor industry developments and stay aware of emerging threats.

5. Educate users:
    - Regularly educate users on best practices and the importance of multi-factor authentication.
    - Educate users on common attack techniques and how to recognize suspicious activity.

6. Establish a documented process for user onboarding and offboarding:
    - Establish defined roles and detail user access requirements.
    - Leverage automation and process documentation to ensure consistency in user provisioning.

7. Use strong credential standards:
    - Use secure passphrases or passwords that are at least 12 characters.
    - Utilize multi-factor authentication to reduce security risks associated with weak credentials and passwords.

8. Automate password rotation:
    - Automate the password rotation process to ensure accounts remain secure.
    - Require users to periodically update their passwords to detect suspicious activity.

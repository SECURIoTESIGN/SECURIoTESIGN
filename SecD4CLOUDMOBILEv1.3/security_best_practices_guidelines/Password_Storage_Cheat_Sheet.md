# Security Best Practices Guidelines for Password Storage 

### Password Storage Best Practices Guidelines

1. **Make your passwords long:**  Use a minimum of 8-10 characters; longer passwords are more secure.

2. **Make your passwords complex:** Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

3. **Avoid using personal and easily guessed details:** Do not use your name, birthdate, address, or any other personally identifiable information in your password.

4. **Do not use the same password for multiple accounts:** It is more secure to use unique passwords for each account.

5. **Keep your passwords safe:** Store them in a secure password manager or use two-factor authentication when available. If you need to write down your passwords, keep them in a secure, locked place.

6. **Change passwords regularly:** Change your passwords at least every 3 months.

7. **Be careful of suspicious links or email attachments:** Never click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown or untrusted sources.

8. **Be alert when logging in:** Always check to make sure you are on a secure, legitimate website.

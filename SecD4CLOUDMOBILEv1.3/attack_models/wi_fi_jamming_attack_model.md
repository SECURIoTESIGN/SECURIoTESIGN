# Wi-Fi Jamming Attack 

Wi-Fi jamming attack is an attack on a wireless network using radio frequency signals to disrupt the normal operation of the network. The goal of the attack is to block or reduce the amount of legitimate traffic that can access the network. This can be done by using powerful signal transmitters to disrupt communications between the access point and its client devices or by blocking the access pointâ€™s radio signal. 

Wi-Fi jamming attacks are a type of denial of service attack that affects wireless networks and can occur on any wireless network regardless of its size. It can cause network outages, reduce throughput, and cause major disruptions for users. Wi-Fi jamming attacks can be difficult to detect and prevent due to their potential for wide area disruption.

## Wi-Fi Jamming Architectural Risk Analysis: 

## Wi-Fi Jamming Attack Vulnerability (CVSS v3.1)
**CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)** 

**Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N) 
This means that the attack occurs remotely over a network.

**Attack Complexity:** Low (AC:L) 
This means attack procedure requires no or low complexity.

**Privileges Required:** None (PR:N)
This means no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. 

**User Interaction:** None (UI:N) 
This means no user interaction is necessary for exploitation.

**Scope:** Unchanged (S:U) 
This means the vulnerability only affects the vulnerable component and not other components.

**Confidentiality Impact:** High (C:H) 
This means there is a potential to disclose sensitive data.

**Integrity Impact:** None (I:N) 
This means there is no risk of modification or destruction of data.

**Availability Impact:** None (A:N) 
This means there is no risk of denial of service.

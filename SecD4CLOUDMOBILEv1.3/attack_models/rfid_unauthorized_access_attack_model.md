# RFID Unauthorized Access Attack 

RFID Unauthorized Access attack is a type of security attack that refers to the use of radio waves to gain unauthorized access to an RFID-enabled system. Attackers using this type of attack leverage the radio waves emitted by an RFID-enabled device to read, modify, or delete data stored on tags or other components in the system. This attack can be used to gain access to sensitive information, such as personal identifiers or financial data, without the knowledge of the device's user. Additionally, it can be used to disrupt or damage the system.

In order to prevent against RFID Unauthorized Access attacks, organizations should take measures to protect their RFID-enabled devices. These measures could include implementing frequent data encryption, implementing access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel are allowed access to the system, and regularly patching systems against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, organizations should be aware of potential physical threats, such as the use of RFID jammers, and take steps to prevent and identify such attacks.

## RFID Unauthorized Access Attack Architectural Risk Analysis: 

| Attack Vector |  Attack Complexity |Privileges Required |  User Interaction|  Scope  |  Confidentiality Impact  | Integrity Impact  | Availability Impact  | 
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
|Network (e.g. Remote)| Low |  None |  None |  Changed |  Low  |  Low  | Low |

**CVSS v3(Base Score: 4.3):**

**AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L**


Impact:

This RFID unauthorized access attack vulnerability has a low CVSS score of 4.3. It could result in a low confidentiality, integrity and availability impact. This means that the attack could allow someone to gain unauthorized access and use of a system, jeopardizing confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. However, this vulnerability does not have a high risk of causing significant harm to the system.

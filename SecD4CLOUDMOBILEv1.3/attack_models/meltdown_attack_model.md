# Meltdown Attack 

Meltdown is a security vulnerability in modern processors that can allow malicious applications to access higher privileged memory. It exploits a processor's speculative execution feature to gain access to memory locations that should otherwise be inaccessible. This vulnerability has the potential to expose sensitive information, such as passwords, from the memory of other processes running on the same system.

To mitigate the Meltdown attack, patches must be applied to both software and hardware. The patch helps restrict an application's access to privileged memory and also ensures that memory access violations do not occur. Also, system administrators should update their systems and disable speculative execution if possible.

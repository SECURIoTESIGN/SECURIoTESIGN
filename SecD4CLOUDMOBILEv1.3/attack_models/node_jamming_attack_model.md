# Node Jamming in WSNs Attack 

Node Jamming is a malicious technique used to disrupt communication within Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It involves flooding the network with noise/interference signals, preventing sensor nodes from being able to communicate with their neighbors, thus resulting in a denial of service. This can be very damaging to the network, as it prevents the WSN from fulfilling its purpose. Attackers may use this technique to disrupt a WSN for a variety of reasons, such as targeting a particular node, preventing access to a certain protected area, or simply to cause disruption.

# Mobile SIM Swapping Attacks

This attack consists of fraudulently obtaining and using a target user's SIM card to gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data or to perform fraudulent activities, such as stealing money from a mobile banking application that requires factorial authentication, the second factor of which is a code sent by SMS to the customer's smartphone.

## Definition

 This attack targets the SIM card of a smartphone user, i.e. swapping the victim user's SIM card. SIM swapping can happen remotely. A cybercriminal, with a few important details about your life in hand, can answer security questions correctly, impersonate you, and convince your mobile carrier to reassign your phone number to a new SIM card. At that point, the criminal can get access to your phoneâ€™s data and start changing your account passwords to lock you out of your online banking profile, email, and more.

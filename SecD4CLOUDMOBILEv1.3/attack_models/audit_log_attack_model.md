# Audit Log Manipulation Attack 

Audit Log Manipulation is a type of cyber attack used to hide or falsify activities in a system's audit log, which can be used to track user activities and system changes. This can be done by either deleting entries in the log, adding false entries, or even modifying existing log entries. This type of attack can be used to mask malicious or suspicious activity from security professionals and prevent them from detecting it. It can also be used to mask financial fraud or other malicious activity.

Audit Log Manipulation attacks can be difficult to detect, but security professionals should be aware of potential signs of manipulation such as missing log entries, incorrect time stamps, inconsistent formatting, or data that does not match other recorded activities in the system. Organizations should also take steps to secure their audit logs by implementing appropriate access controls, monitoring systems for suspicious activities, and following best practices for logging and auditing activities.

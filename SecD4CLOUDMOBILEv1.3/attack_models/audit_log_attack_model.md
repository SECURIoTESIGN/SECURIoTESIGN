# Audit Log Manipulation Attack 

Audit Log Manipulation is a type of cyber attack used to hide or falsify activities in a system's audit log, which can be used to track user activities and system changes. This can be done by either deleting entries in the log, adding false entries, or even modifying existing log entries. This type of attack can be used to mask malicious or suspicious activity from security professionals and prevent them from detecting it. It can also be used to mask financial fraud or other malicious activity.

## Mitigation

Audit log manipulation is a serious security concern as it can allow malicious actors to hide their activities. Here are some strategies to mitigate this risk in Cloud, Mobile, and IoT ecosystems:

1. **Immutable Logs**: Ensure that your logs are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are written¹. This can prevent an attacker from altering the logs to hide their activities¹.

2. **Log Redundancy**: Maintain redundant copies of logs in different locations¹. This can make it harder for an attacker to manipulate all copies of the logs¹.

3. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and audit your logs to detect any unusual activities or potential security breaches¹.

4. **Use of Secure Cloud Services**: Use secure cloud services for IoT devices. These services provide a spectrum of capabilities, including data storage, data processing, and application hosting, which can help IoT devices collect, analyze, and share data securely².

5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the cloud or transmitting it over the network¹.

6. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can access the logs¹. This can prevent unauthorized users from manipulating the logs¹.

7. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Use IDS to monitor your systems and generate alerts when suspicious activities are detected¹.

8. **Security by Design**: Secure application development across these three technologies can only be achieved when applications and systems are designed and developed with security in mind¹. This will improve the quality of the solutions and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified¹.

Remember, the key to effective mitigation is a proactive approach to security. Regularly updating security measures and staying informed about the latest threats can go a long way in protecting your systems from Audit log manipulation and other cyber threats.

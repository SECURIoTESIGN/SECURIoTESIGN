# Cookie Poisoning Attack 

Cookie Poisoning is a type of attack that an attacker uses to modify a web browser's cookie data. It is used to gain unauthorized access to a user's account, steal their personal information, or inject malicious code into a website. 

This type of attack usually involves the attacker sending out malicious scripts that modify a user's cookie data. The attacker can then use the cookies to gain access to the user's personal information or inject malicious code into a website. 

Cookie poisoning attacks can also be used to disrupt a website's functionality and lead to denial of service attacks.

Fortunately, cookie poisoning attacks can be mitigated with proper security measures. For example, organizations can use encryption and other types of data protection techniques to make cookies more secure. They can also use firewalls and other security controls to protect their networks from attackers. Additionally, web developers can build safer websites by using anti-CSRF tokens and other security measures.

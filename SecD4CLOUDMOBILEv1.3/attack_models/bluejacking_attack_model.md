# Bluejacking Attack 

## What is Bluejacking?

Bluejacking is a type of attack where an attacker sends anonymous messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluejacking attacks often involve malicious content, such as malicious links, malicious images, or malicious text. These messages can be sent from any device that can send Bluetooth signals, such as laptops, mobile phones, and even some home appliances.

## What are the Potential Consequences of a Bluejacking Attack?

The potential consequences of a Bluejacking attack include:

- Leaking of sensitive data from the target device.
- Unauthorized access to the target device.
- Installation of malicious software on the target device.
- Manipulation of personal information on the target device.
- Remote control of the target device.

## What are the Steps to Prevent Bluejacking?

The following steps can help minimize the potential risk of a Bluejacking attack:

- Disable Bluetooth on all devices when not in use.
- Use a PIN code with at least 8 characters on all Bluetooth enabled devices.
- Change Bluetooth visibility settings to only be visible to approved contacts.
- Make sure anti-virus and firewall software is installed and up to date.
- Install application and software updates as soon as they are available.

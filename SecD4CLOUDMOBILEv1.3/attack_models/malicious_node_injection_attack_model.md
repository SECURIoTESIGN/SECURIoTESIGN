# Malicious Node Injection Attack 

Malicious Node Injection is a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious code into an existing application's code. The malicious code can run automatically when the application is executed, allowing the attacker to take control of the application or gain access to sensitive data.

The malicious code can be inserted at any point in the application, from the application source code to the compiled executable code. The malicious code can be inserted into an application on the client side or server side.

This attack can be used to gain access to sensitive data, hijack the application, and perform other malicious activities.

To protect against this attack, developers can use secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security patching.  Additionally, using a well-known software package with regular security updates is also recommended.

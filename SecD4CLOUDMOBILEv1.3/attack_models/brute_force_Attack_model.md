# Brute Force Attack 

A Brute Force attack is a type of attack that attempts to guess a user's authentication credentials, such as a username and password, by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is discovered. It is commonly used to gain unauthorised access to secure systems.

It is important to note that Brute Force attacks are often used in combination with other tactics, such as dictionary and rainbow table attacks, to increase the chances of success.


## Mitigation

1. **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce the use of strong passwords. Passwords should be long, complex, and unique.

2. **Account Lockout Policies**: After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account should be temporarily locked out.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implementing 2FA can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks.

4. **Captcha**: Use a CAPTCHA system to prevent automated scripts from performing brute force attacks.

5. **Delay Between Login Attempts**: Introduce a delay between login attempts. This slows down an attacker and makes brute force attacks less feasible.

6. **Blacklist/Whitelist IP Addresses**: Blacklist IP addresses that are clearly engaging in malicious activities, and whitelist known good IP addresses.

7. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A WAF can help detect and block brute force attacks.

8. **Limit Login Attempts**: Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a certain time period.

9. **Monitor and Log Failed Logins**: Keep an eye on failed login attempts and set up alerts for suspicious activities.

10. **Use of AI and Machine Learning**: These technologies can learn and adapt to new threats and unusual login patterns, offering another layer of security.

Remember, these are general strategies and may need to be adapted based on the specific use case and environment. It's also important to note that security is a multi-layered approach where one method's weakness is covered by the strength of another. Therefore, a combination of these strategies will provide more robust protection against brute force attacks.

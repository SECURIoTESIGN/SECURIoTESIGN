# Brute Force Attack 

A Brute Force attack is a type of attack that attempts to guess a user's authentication credentials, such as a username and password, by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is discovered. It is commonly used to gain unauthorised access to secure systems.

It is important to note that Brute Force attacks are often used in combination with other tactics, such as dictionary and rainbow table attacks, to increase the chances of success.

In order to protect against this type of attack, it is recommended to use strong authentication credentials that are difficult to guess, such as long, randomised passwords made up of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. It is also a good idea to set a maximum amount of failed log-in attempts before locking out the user account, as this prevents attackers from attempting to guess the credentials indefinitely.

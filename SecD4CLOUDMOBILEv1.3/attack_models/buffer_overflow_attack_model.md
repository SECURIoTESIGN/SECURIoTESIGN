# Buffer Overflow Attack

A buffer overflow attack is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program writes data beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. Let’s break down the details:

## How It Happens

*Buffer*: A buffer is a temporary storage area in a program’s memory. It holds data such as strings, arrays, or other variables.

*Overflow*: When a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold, the excess data spills over into adjacent memory locations.

*Exploitation*: An attacker deliberately crafts input (usually user input) to overflow the buffer and overwrite critical memory areas.

## Consequences

Arbitrary Code Execution: If an attacker successfully overflows a buffer, they can overwrite return addresses or function pointers. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control over the program.
Denial of Service (DoS): Buffer overflows can crash programs, causing service disruptions.
Information Leakage: Sensitive data (such as passwords or encryption keys) stored in adjacent memory locations may be exposed.

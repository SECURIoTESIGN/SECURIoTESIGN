# Malicious QR Code Attacks

In this type of attacks, attackers encode malicious links that lead e.g. to phishing sites or to execute fraudulent code. These malicious QR codes can be printed on small stickers and pasted over already existing QR codes. Furthermore, attackers can modify selected modules from white to black and vice-versa in order to override the originally encoded content.

## Definition

QR code-based attack is defined as an attack that attempts to lure victims into scanning a QR code that directs them to malicious websites. The key idea behind QR code attacks is that victims might trust the web page or the printed material on which the QR code is displayed, and assume that the associated code is harmless. In addition, attackers use malicious QR codes to direct users to fraudulent web sites, which masquerade as legitimate web sites aiming to steal sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords or credit card information. 

## Attacker Powers

 * Direct the user to an exploit or phishing site;
 * Perform other attacks such as phishing, farming and botnet;
 * Distribute malware;
 * Extraction of personal and confidential data from smartphones and tablets via command injection or traditional buffer overflows by reader software;
 * Steal users' Money via fraud;
 * Social Engineering attacks via spear phishing e.g. leaving a poster of a QR Code on the parking lot of a company (instead of the traditional attack with an USB drive) offering discount in a nearby restaurant is a new attack vector which is likely to be successful.

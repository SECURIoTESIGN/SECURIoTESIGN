# Integrity 

Is the property of safeguarding the correctness and completeness of assets in a Cloud & Mobile system. In other words it involves maintaining the data consistent,   trustworthy and accurate during it life-cycle.

## This requirements is applied in the Cloud and Mobile Ecosystem.

Not addressing this requirement may lead to vulnerabilities explored by attacks such as:                                                        

## SQL Injection Attacks:                                          
In this type of attack, the attacker inserts malicious code with the intention of accessing the unauthorized database for the purpose of obtaining confidential or critical data from the legitimate user.

## Wrapping Attacks:                                                       
In a wrapping attack scenario, the attacker duplicates the SOAP message in the course of the translation and sends it to the server as a legitimate user. Therefore, the attacker may interfere with the malicious code.

## MITM Attacks:                                                             
In this type of attack, an attacker attempts to intrude on a mail exchange or continuous message between two users or clients of a cloud-based mobile application (client-server).


## Cookie Poisoning:                                                     
This type of attack consists of replacing or modifying cookie content in ways to gain unauthorized access to applications or Web pages.
